            "A compact and short tampon applicator is formed of an outer barrel which surrounds a tampon-holding inner tubular plunger which is slidable within the outer barrel. A portion of the wall of the plunger defines a pair of hinged panels which snap into the interior of the plunger in response to an inwardly directed radial force. This inward force is supplied by a tab on the barrel, once the plunger has been retracted sufficiently out of the barrel to register the hinged panels with the tab. The applicator is readied for use by retracting the plunger rearwardly behind the tampon, sufficiently to cause the hinged panels to engage the tab on the inner surface of the barrel to snap into the plunger. After insertion of the barrel into the catamenial canal, the plunger is pressed inward, back into the barrel, to enable its inwardly snapped panels to engage the rear of the tampon and to eject the tampon through the front of the barrel.\n",

One of the metal ladders is connected to a power supply at the bottom metal layer, corresponding to a logic 1, and another metal ladder is connected to ground at the bottom metal layer, corresponding to a logic 0.

            "A memory cell for reducing the cost and complexity of modifying a revision identifier (ID) or default register values associated with an integrated circuit (IC) chip, and a method for manufacturing the same. The cell, which may be termed a “Meta-Memory Cell” (MMCEL), is implemented on metal layers only and utilizes a dual parallel metal ladder structure that traverses and covers each metal and via layer from the bottom to the top of the metal layer structure of the chip. One of the metal ladders is connected to a power supply at the bottom metal layer, corresponding to a logic 1, and another metal ladder is connected to ground at the bottom metal layer, corresponding to a logic 0. The output of the MMCEL can thus be inverted at any metal or via layer and can be inverted as often as required. Significant cost savings are achieved because a revision ID or default register bits may be modified by altering only those metal layers where design changes are necessary.\n",

As a result, a diffractive effect achieved by the projections/depressions of the two-dimensional periodic structure change the direction in which the light radiated from the active layer ( 3 ) travels. If the projections/depressions are not provided, light at a radiation angle which satisfies conditions for total reflection at the interface between a semiconductor device and an air cannot be extracted to the outside of the semiconductor device so that the light emission efficiency of the device is low. By contrast, the projections/depressions as formed with a period according to the present invention diffract the light at an angle which does not cause total reflection so that the efficiency with which the light is extracted to the outside of the semiconductor device is improved exponentially.

            "An electronic video gaming machine programmed to play a multi-hand five-card (or seven-card) draw poker (or stud poker) game that includes the use of a three by three matrix of nine cards. This three by three matrix of cards generates eight three-card hands (i.e., three horizontal rows, three vertical columns, and two diagonals). These cards are used in combination with two (or four) communal cards dealt to the player and situated adjacent to the three by three matrix to complete the five (or seven) card poker hand. The player makes a credit wager on each of the eight play hands (pay-lines) the player is interested in wagering on. The player also makes a wager on the anticipated number of winning hands that will be obtained. One standard fifty-two-card deck (with or without jokers) is typically used in a single play round. In the draw poker version, the player may decide to hold any number of cards contained in the three by three matrix or decide to discard any or all nine cards. Replacement cards for the non-held cards are dealt in each location. Each of the eight different five (or seven) card hands are analyzed to determine its poker hand ranking and winning hands are paid in accordance with a pay table provided.

            "A memory system or flash card may include a mechanism for memory cell measurement and analysis that independently measures/predicts memory wear/endurance, data retention (DR), read disturb, and/or remaining margin. These effects may be independently quantified by analyzing the state distributions of the individual voltage levels of the cells. In particular, a histogram of cell voltage distributions of the memory cells can be analyzed to identify signatures for certain effects (e.g. wear, DR, read disturb, margin, etc.). Those measurements may be used for block cycling, data loss prediction, or adjustments to memory parameters. Pre-emptive action at the appropriate time based on the measurements may lead to improved memory management and data management. That action may include calculating the remaining useful life of data stored in memory, cycling blocks, predicting data loss, trade-off or dynamic adjustments of memory parameters.\n",

A fixed number of the magnetic memory cells forms a memory unit to store a burst data. A read/write device is implemented between the memory units to read or write the burst data to the magnetic memory cells passing the read/write device. A flag unit records a flag value for each memory track or each memory unit to indicate whether the burst data is located at a first side or a second side of the read/write device. A current unit provides an operation current to the magnetic memory track according to the flag value to move the domain walls to pass the read/write device. After the read/write device reads or writes the burst data, the flag value is updated.\n",

This reversible carbonaceous layer acts as a base for electrodeless deposition of a metal to form a bridge across the discontinuity by laser-enhanced exchange plating or other suitable methods. Further, a means of accessing and repairing a discontinuity buried by a cover layer of an insulating or passivating material is described, wherein access to the discontinuity is provided by ablating away the cover layer using a pulsed excimer laser at a first power level.\n",

Interference screws or other fixation devices are used to secure the graft within the tunnel. For tibial tunnel fixation using an interference screw, the back end of the distal screw is angled so that it closely approximates the angle of the outer tibial tunnel rim. The distal screw is non-cannulated to prevent hematomas from being formed by blood flowing from the tibial tunnel into the surrounding soft tissue. The proximal screw has a restricted cannula to minimize the flow of synovial fluid entering the tibial tunnel. Advantageously, the space between the two screws fills with blood to promote faster healing and incorporation of the graft in the tibial tunnel.\n",

One embodiment creates a root issue object for each change request object and allows a user to partition an issue object into issue sub-objects. The embodiment (a) allows a user to create a task object to define the work needed to address an issue and allows a user to partition a task object into task sub-objects, and (b) allows a user to create an activity object to track work performed and allows a user to partition an activity object into activity sub-objects. Issue objects and issue sub-objects are relatable to task objects and task sub-objects. Task objects and task sub-objects are relatable to activity objects and activity sub-objects.

The handle is pivoted to the other side of the body opposite to the rotatable disk in a liftable and foldable manner. The pivoting position between the handle and body corresponds to the center of the rotatable disk. Via this arrangement, the deformation of the conductive pieces caused by a torque generated in misalignment with the center can be avoided and the user can unplug more easily with less labor.\n",
