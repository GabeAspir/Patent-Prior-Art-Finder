US-7365259-B2,"A keyboard apparatus is including a plurality of keys and a plurality of mass members provided under the respective keys to be pivotably supported on a keyboard frame being a support member, each of the mass members extends along a longitudinal direction of the key and has a mass concentration part in its rear end portion, and when not driven by a mass driving part of the key, each of the mass members is in an inclined state with the mass concentration part being at the lowest descended position. The keyboard frame has a rib provided between two adjacent mass members among the plural mass members, and at least part of a lower edge of the rib is formed along lower edges of the mass members in the inclined state.","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   1. Field of the Invention 
   The invention relates to a keyboard apparatus used in electronic keyboard instruments such as an electronic organ, an electronic piano, and a synthesizer, or in electric keyboard instruments. 
   2. Description of the Related Art 
   Some of conventional keyboard apparatuses used in electronic keyboard instruments such as electronic organs and electronic pianos also include mass members generally called hammers in correspondence to respective keys, so as to provide a heavy touch feeling close to a key touch feeling of an acoustic musical instrument such as a piano. The hammers pivot in linkage with a key depression operation of the respective keys to give a force depending on their movement as a reactive force against a key depression force, thereby providing a desired key depression touch feeling. 
   For example, a keyboard apparatus disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,834,668 B is structured such that keys and mass members extending under the keys along a key longitudinal direction are pivotably supported on a keyboard frame being a support member, and when the keys are depressed, the mass members are driven to pivot by force transmitting parts provided under the keys, and inertia moment generating parts in a metal bar-shape thereof are lifted with a large stroke to provide a heavy key touch feeling. When the keys are released, the mass members pivot in a reverse direction and the inertia moment generating parts return to a descended position. 
   In order to allow the inertia moment generating parts of the mass members to thus move up/down with a large stroke at the time of key depression/release, it is necessary for the support member to have a large space under the keys. 
   Further, in a case where the support member is formed of resin, ribs are formed for coupling support parts and reinforcing the whole support member. The ribs are arranged at intervals in an arrangement direction of the keys and the mass members to extend in parallel to the longitudinal direction of the keys and the mass members, and these ribs are provided also in the vicinity of a lower end of the support member. 
   Therefore, the space under the keys cannot be used effectively and in particular, does not allow long functional components and so on in the arrangement direction of the keys and the mass members (key width direction) to be disposed. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   The invention was made to solve such problems, and an object thereof is to provide a keyboard apparatus including mass members corresponding to respective keys, in which a space formed under keys in a support member supporting the keys and the mass members can be effectively used without interfering with the ascending/descending movement of inertia moment generating parts when the mass members pivot. 
   The invention is a keyboard apparatus including: a support member; a plurality of keys pivotably supported on the support member; and a plurality of mass members provided under the respective keys to be pivotably supported on the support member via pivotal fulcrum parts and driven to pivot via mass member driving parts provided under the plural keys respectively, and the following structure is adopted in order to attain the above object. 
   The plural mass members extend along a longitudinal direction of the keys, having mass concentration parts in rear end portions thereof, and are mounted on the support member in such a manner that, when not driven, the mass members are in an inclined state with the mass concentration parts being at a lowest descended position. 
   The support member has a rib provided between predetermined two adjacent mass members among the plural mass members and at least part of a lower edge of the rib is formed along lower edges of the mass members that are not driven and are in the inclined state. 
   Another possible structure is such that the pivotal fulcrum parts of the mass members are provided at a predetermined height position from a lowest end of the support member, whereby a space outside a movement range of the mass members is formed under the mass members, and an uppermost portion of the space coincides with the part of the lower edge of the rib. 
   A printed circuit board or a speaker can be disposed in the space outside the movement range of the mass members. 
   Alternatively, a lower case is mounted on the lowest end of the support member, the lower case has an recessed portion recessed into the space, and the recessed portion serves as a functional component housing part. 
   The recessed portion can also serve as a battery housing part storing batteries or a battery pack, and a cover may be detachably attached to the lower case to cover the recessed portion. 
   The recessed portion is also allowed to be used as an accessories housing part where it stores accessories such as a code or a microphone. 
   In the keyboard apparatus according to the invention, the space formed under the keys in the support member supporting the keys and the mass members can be effectively used without interfering with the ascending/descending movement of the inertia moment generating parts when the mass members pivot. For example, in a case of a portable electronic keyboard instrument, it is possible to store batteries or a battery pack or accessories such as cords and microphones which are necessary, without providing an extra space, that is, without increasing a dimension in a height direction of the keyboard apparatus. 
   Moreover, as the functional components, for example, a printed circuit board constituting an electronic circuit such as an amplifier, speakers and so on, or bending-preventive rigidity generating members for increasing rigidity in the key arrangement direction of the keyboard apparatus (ribs, reinforcing members, and the like extending in the key arrangement direction) can be disposed under the lower edges of the ribs, that is, in the space under the mass members. Further, in a case where the lower case is provided, a temporary support member can be inserted in the recessed portion of the lower case to temporarily support the keyboard frame on the lower case when the support member (keyboard frame) and the lower case are assembled. 
   Incidentally, if only two or three dispersed places of a bottom face of the support member constitute the lowest end of the support member, the keyboard apparatus does not wobble and can be placed on a key bed of a keyboard instrument stably in a case where the keyboard apparatus is directly mounted on the key bed without having the lower case. 
   The above and other objects, features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following detailed description which is to be read in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

   First, the configuration of the electronic musical instrument shown in  FIG. 1  will be mainly described. This electronic musical instrument  1  is an electronic keyboard instrument such as a desktop electronic organ, electronic piano, or synthesizer, and includes a keyboard apparatus  2 , an upper case  60 , a lower case  70 , and electronic circuit parts, a speaker, and so on, which are not shown. 
   The keyboard apparatus  2  is structured such that many white keys  20  and black keys  40  are mounted on a key mounting part  10 K of a keyboard frame  10  being a support member, and is housed in a case composed of the upper case  60  and the lower case  70 , with only key main bodies to which a key depression operation is performed being exposed. The upper case  60  and the lower case  70  are engaged with each other, and are fastened to the keyboard frame  10  being a keyboard support member with setscrews  71  and a plurality of not-shown setscrews to be coupled to each other. 
   The upper case  60  has a key slip  64  on its front face and also has on an upper face of its rear portion a music stand mounting groove  61  in which a music stand  62  is inserted for mounting. Rubber legs  76  are attached to four corners of a bottom face of the lower case  70 . 
   The white keys  20  and the black keys  40  in one octave key range compose one set of a key unit KU as shown in, for example,  FIG. 5 . The key unit KU is composed of a first white key unit KUW 1 , a second white key unit KUW 2 , and a black key unit KUB. 
   The first white key unit KUW 1  includes four white keys  20  being whole tone keys (keys C, E, G, B shown in  FIG. 2 ) which are every other keys from an outer side of one octave, and key main bodies  23  of these white keys  20  are coupled to a common key support part  21  via respective coupling parts  24  to be pivotable in a key depression/release direction. 
   The second white key unit KUW 2  includes the other three white keys  20  being whole tone keys (keys D, F, A shown in  FIG. 2 ) which are every other keys, and key main bodies  23  of these white keys  20  are coupled to a common key support part  22  via respective coupling parts  24  to be pivotable in the key depression/release direction. 
   The black key unit KUB includes black keys  40  (keys C#, D#, F#, G#, A# shown by the solid line in  FIG. 2 ) shown by the virtual line in  FIG. 5  which are five half-tone keys, and key main bodies  43  thereof are coupled to a common key support part  41  via respective coupling parts  42  to be pivotable in the key depression/release direction. 
   In  FIG. 5 , reference numeral  23 ,  43  denote the key main bodies of the white keys  20  and the black keys  40  respectively, and needless to say, the key main bodies  23  of the white keys  20  (hereinafter, referred to as “white key main bodies”) are longer in the longitudinal length than the key main bodies  43  of the black keys  40  (hereinafter, referred to as “black key main bodies”). 
   Here, “white keys” and “black keys” do not necessarily mean “keys in white color” and “keys in black color”, but for convenience sake, as described above, “white keys” refer to keys whose key main bodies have flat upper faces and longer length and which produce whole tones when depressed, and “black keys” refer to keys whose key main bodies bulge upward from the white keys and have shorter length and which produce half tones when depressed. Therefore, even in a case where black and white colors are reversed in actual keys, keys having the shape and function corresponding to the above-described white keys are called “white keys” and keys having the shape and function corresponding to the above-described black keys are called “black keys”. 
   The respective common key support parts  21 ,  22 ,  41  of the first white key unit KUW 1 , the second white key unit KUW 2 , and the black key unit KUB are stacked to form a common key support part  30  as shown also in  FIG. 6 . The common key support part  30  is formed by integrating the common key support parts  21 ,  22 ,  41  in such a manner that a fitting recessed groove  22   a  formed in the common key support part  22  of the second white key unit KUW 2  is fitted in alignment to a fitting protrusion  21   b  in a rail shape formed in the common key support part  21  of the first white key unit KUW 1 , and a fitting recessed groove  41   a  formed in the common key support part  41  of the black key unit KUB is fitted in alignment to a fitting protrusion  22   b  in a rail shape formed in the common key support part  22 . 
   Further, a fitting recessed groove  21   a  formed in the common key support part  21  of the first white key unit KUW 1  is fitted in alignment to a fitting protrusion  15  in a rail shape formed in a key mounting part  10 K of the keyboard frame  10 . Then, key unit assembly screws  82  shown in  FIG. 1  are inserted for assembly from above in mounting holes  26 ,  26 ,  44  of the common key support parts  21 ,  22 ,  41  forming the common key support part  30  to be screwed in common key support part mounting screw holes  17  of the key mounting part  10 K shown in  FIG. 6 , so that the common key support parts  21 ,  22 ,  41  are commonly fixed to the key mounting part  10 K. 
   In this manner, the first white key unit KUW 1 , the second white key unit KUW 2 , and the black key unit KUB are assembled on the keyboard frame  10  as the key unit KU corresponding to one octave as shown in  FIG. 2 . The necessary number of the key units KU corresponding to the necessary key range are continuously arranged in a key arrangement direction and are assembled, whereby the keyboard apparatus with the necessary number of keys can be structured. 
   Here, the shapes and so on of the respective coupling parts  24  of the first and second white key units KUW 1 , KUW 2  and the coupling parts  42  of the black key unit KUB will be described in detail with reference to  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 5  to  FIG. 8 . 
   The coupling part  42  via which each of the black key main bodies  43  of the black key unit KUB is coupled to the common key support part  41  to be pivotable in the key depression direction is made wide, with its total width Wa in the key arrangement direction being wider than a key width Wb of the black key main body  43 , as clearly shown in  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 8 , so that parts Wc, Wd (for Wa, Wb, Wc, Wd, refer to  FIG. 8 ) thereof overlap with the coupling parts  24  of the adjacent white keys  20 , and the black key  40  is restricted from yawing in the key width direction by the coupling part  42  when depressed/released. 
   As clearly shown in  FIG. 6  and  FIG. 8 , each of the coupling parts  42  of the black keys  40  is composed of a thin hinge part  42   b  allowing the key to pivot at the time of key depression/release and a thick connecting part  42   a  higher in rigidity than the thin hinge part  42   b . The thick connecting part  42   a  extends backward from a rear end portion  43   e  ( FIG. 8 ) of the black key main body  43 , with both sides thereof protruding from both side faces of the rear end portion  43   e  in the adjacent key directions respectively and is connected to the thin hinge part  42   b  and is further coupled to the common key support part  41  via the thin hinge part. The thin hinge part  42   b  has an opening  47  in its key widthwise middle portion and is divided by the opening  47  into right and left portions, as clearly shown in  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 8 . 
   The thin hinge part  42   b  thus formed functions with the thick connecting part  42   a  to enhance a sectional secondary moment against a key widthwise (lateral direction) force while increasing flexibility in the key depression direction, so that it is possible to fully restrict yawing in the key width direction of the black key main body  43  without using a key guide. 
   In the coupling part  42 , a protrusion amount of the thick connecting part  42   a  from the both side faces of the rear end portion  43   e  of the black key main body  43  differs depending on each of the black keys  40  as shown in  FIG. 2 . The right and left protrusion amounts are not necessarily equal and the width thereof differs depending on each key. In any case, the wide part as the black key coupling part of each black key can have an average width corresponding to 12/5=2.4 keys, and the total width thereof in the key width direction is made as wide as possible, thereby increasing the effect of restricting the yawing in the key width direction of the key main body  43 . 
   On the other hand, as for each of the coupling parts  24  via which the white key main bodies  23  of the first and second white key units KUW 1 , KUW 2  are coupled to the respective common key support parts  21  and  22  to be pivotable in the key depression direction, a total width We in the key arrangement direction of the coupling part  24  is narrower than the aforesaid total width Wa in the key arrangement direction of the coupling part  42  of the black key unit KUB and is substantially equal to the width of a rear end portion of the white key main body  23 , as clearly shown in  FIG. 5  and  FIG. 7 . 
   Each of the coupling parts  24  is composed of a thin horizontal hinge part  24   a  extending in the key width direction and a vertical hinge part  24   b  extending in the thickness direction and along the longitudinal direction of the key as shown also in  FIG. 6 . The vertical hinge part  24   b  is formed in a shape of the character “H” rotated by 90° when seen from above, as clearly shown in  FIG. 5 . A front end portion of the thin horizontal hinge part  24   a  is integrally connected to the rear end  43   e  of the white key main body  23 , and a rear end portion of the vertical hinge part  24   b  is integrally connected to the common key support part  21  or  22 . 
   The horizontal hinge part  24   a  supports the white key main body  23  so as to allow the white key main body  23  to pivot in the key depression direction, and the vertical hinge part  24   b  supports the white key main body  23  so as to allow the white key main body  23  to pivot in the key width direction. Therefore, the positioning in the key arrangement direction of the front end portions of the white key main bodies  23  and the restriction of yawing thereof are realized by later-described guide parts provided on free end sides of the white keys  20 . 
   The reason why the vertical hinge part  24   b  exists is to prevent the occurrence of stress in the key free end portion at the time of the key depression/release even if contraction error at the time of molding and variation among respective parts during the thermal cooling cause slight variation in positional accuracy of a key guide part  12  and/or a guided part  33 , which will be described later, because the keyboard frame  10  and the key unit KU are formed of resin. 
   As previously described, the coupling part  42  of the black key  40  has the overlapping portions that partly overlap with the coupling parts  24  of the adjacent white keys  20 , with its total width in the key width direction being larger than the key width of the rear end of the black key main body  43 , as clearly shown in  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 5 . 
   Further, as parts of the overlapping portions in the coupling part  42 , in the thick connecting part  42   a , protruding in the adjacent key directions from the both side faces of the rear end portion  43   e  of the black key main body  43  overlap with the upper faces of the rear end portions of the key main bodies  23  of the adjacent white keys  20 . Also, as shown in  FIG. 6  and  FIG. 7 , the white key main body  23  has in its rear end portion the escape part  25  that is formed by setting the height of an upper face  23   a  of the rear end portion thereof lower than the height of the other portion. When the black key unit KUB is stacked on the first and second white key units KUW 1 , KUW 2  to form the keyboard apparatus, the thick connecting parts  42   a  which are part of the coupling parts  42  of the black keys  40  are fitted in the escape parts  25  of the white key main bodies  23 . In this embodiment, owing to this structure, the upper faces  23   a  of the white key main bodies  23  are flush with upper faces of the thick connecting parts  42   a  of the coupling parts  42  of the black keys  40 . 
   With this structure, in a keyboard apparatus in which no guide part needs to be provided for at least the black keys  40 , hinge mechanisms by the coupling parts  24 ,  42  of the white keys  20  and the black keys  40  are all positioned below the upper faces  23   a  of the white key main bodies  23 . This prevents an increase in height and yet enhances a scope for mounting design (panel layout and the like) in the vicinity of fulcrums of the keys. Moreover, since pivotal fulcrums of the black keys  40  and the white keys  20  are vertically close to each other, a keyboard apparatus higher in performability and also key operability could be realized. Particularly, an operation for playing the scales (for example, by keys of C, C#, D, D#, E, F, . . . ) becomes easy. 
   Additionally, it is possible to prevent an increase in height of the keyboard apparatus and yet to increase the thickness of the white key main bodies  23 , so that the white key main bodies  23  are prevented from bending when depressed. Further, the key depression becomes close to parallel key depression owing to the increased length of the white key main bodies  23 , which enhances performability. 
   As for the black keys  40 , it is possible to secure a sufficient thickness without increasing the height of the thick connecting parts  42   a  of the coupling parts  42 , which can enhance rigidity against yawing in the key width direction. 
   Returning to  FIG. 1 , the structure of the keyboard frame  10  being a support member and its related parts will now be described. 
   In  FIG. 1 , the keyboard frame  10  is composed of a lower front part positioned on a lower left side, a lower rear part positioned on a lower right side, an upper part positioned on an upper side, and rib parts reinforcing and connecting these parts, and these parts are integrally formed of resin. 
   In the lower front part, formed are guide support parts  11  with which white key guides  12  are integrally formed, a lower limit stopper support part  10 F for white keys, a key unit slide face  19 , a mass member mounting part  10 G boss parts  10   e  to  10   g  for fixing the lower case, and so on. In the lower rear part, a mass member lower limit stopper support part  10 L, a boss part  10   h  for fixing the lower case, and so on are provided. Further, in the upper part, a key mounting part  10 K, a switch board mounting part  10 S, a mass member upper limit stopper support part  10 H, an upper component mounting part  10 J, and so on are formed. 
   The key unit slide face  19  is used at the time of the aforesaid mounting of the key unit KU on the keyboard frame  10 . Specifically, when the key unit KU is inserted through a gap between the guide support parts  11  and the switch board  80  from a front side of the keyboard frame  10 , lower end faces  29   a ,  45   a  of the later-described mass driving parts  29 ,  45  provided on the white keys  20  and the black keys  40  respectively are brought into contact with and are slid on a slope of the key unit slide face  19 , so that fitting parts  291 ,  451  of the mass member driving parts  29 ,  45  can be automatically fitted between the main driven parts  53 W,  53 B and the sub driven parts  54 W,  54 B of the later-described white key mass members  50 W and black key mass members  50 B. 
   Therefor, the top and bottom surfaces of the fitting parts  291 ,  451  are fitted between the main driven parts  53 W,  53 B and the sub driven parts  54 W,  54 B, the power between the keys and the mass members are transmitted in the both direction of key depression/release. 
   Components such as an operation panel board housed in the upper part of the upper case  60  can be mounted on the upper component mounting part  10 J. 
   Each of the rib parts is composed of: a rib  10   a  under the white key lower limit stopper support part  10 F and the key unit slide face  19 ; a rib  10   b  above the boss part  10   f ; a rib  10   c  on an inner side of the mass member mounting part  10 G, and a main rib  10   d  connecting the lower front part, the lower rear part, and the upper part. The plural rib parts (about two per one octave) each composed of these ribs extend along the key longitudinal direction and are arranged at intervals in the key arrangement direction, as shown in  FIG. 2 . 
   On an upper face of the white key lower limit stopper support part  10 F, a white key lower limit stopper  34  made of a belt-shaped felt material and extending in the key arrangement direction is pasted and held. On an upper face of the mass member lower limit stopper support part  10 L, a mass member lower limit stopper  84  made of a belt-shaped felt material and extending in the arrangement direction of the later-described mass members (hammers)  50 W,  50 B is pasted and held, as shown also in  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 9 . Further, on a lower face of the mass member upper limit stopper support part  10 H, a mass member upper limit stopper  83  made of a belt-shaped felt material and extending in the arrangement direction of the mass members  50 W,  50 B is pasted and held as shown also in  FIG. 7 . 
   Here, the guide parts of the white keys will be described with reference to  FIG. 2  to  FIG. 4 . 
   On an upper portion on a front end side of the keyboard frame  10 , the plate-shaped guide support parts  11  are arranged at positions corresponding to the vicinities of the free ends of the respective white keys along the arrangement direction of the white keys  20  as shown in  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 3 . The plate-shaped white key guides  12  are formed vertically to protrude forward from front faces of the respective guide support parts  11 . The guide support parts  11  and the white key guides  12  form T-shaped guide members when seen from above or from under as shown in  FIG. 2  by the broken line and in  FIG. 4  by the virtual line. 
   In a tip portion  20   a  of the white key main body  23  on the free end side of each of the white keys  20 , as shown in  FIG. 4  where the bottom view thereof is shown, an outer front end wall  31  is provided in a front end which is a portion seen from outside when the keyboard apparatus  2  is housed in the case. An upper face portion protrudes slightly forward therefrom. An inner front end wall  32  is formed on an inner side of the outer front end wall  31  to have the same height as the entire height of the tip portion  20   a  of the white key main body  23 . In a key widthwise middle portion of the inner front end wall  32 , a slit  33   a  extending from a lower end along the key height direction is formed and a pair of guided parts  33  bending and protruding forward are formed symmetrically. A gap width of the slit  33   a  of the guided parts  33  is slightly larger than the thickness of the white key guide  12 . 
   At the time of the aforesaid mounting of the key unit KU on the keyboard frame  10 , the white key guides  12  are inserted in the slits  33   a  of the guided parts  33  of the respective white keys  20  as shown in  FIG. 2  to  FIG. 4 , thereby positioning the tip portions of the white keys  20  and restricting yawing at the time of the key depression. Incidentally, since the white key main bodies  23  are pivotable in the key width direction owing to the function of the aforesaid vertical hinge parts  24   b  of the coupling parts  24 , it is possible to easily align the arrangement positions of the white key main bodies  23  even with a slight manufacturing error or a slight assembly error, which realizes a smooth key depression/release operation. Preferably, the white key guides  12  and the guided parts  33  of the white keys  20  are coated with lubricating grease. 
   Returning again to  FIG. 1 , the switch board  80  is hooked by a switch board locking hook  35  to be mounted on the switch board mounting part  10 S of the keyboard frame  10 . On the switch board  80 , many key switches  81  are arranged at positions corresponding to longitudinal middle portions of the white keys  20  and the black keys  40 , as shown also in  FIG. 2  by the broken lines. 
   Each of the key switches  81  has a dome-shaped movable part made of synthetic rubber. The movable part has a pair of pressed parts (two small circles shown by the broken lines in  FIG. 2 ) and has, on an inner side of the pair of the pressed parts, a pair of movable contacts made of conductive rubber, and the respective movable contacts face two sets of fixed contacts formed on the switch board  80  to constitute a two-contact (two-make) key switch. When the white key  20  or the black key  40  is depressed, the bottom face thereof presses the movable part, so that the pair of movable contacts sequentially touch the two sets of fixed contacts to turn ON the contacts, and accordingly, a key depression signal is outputted. Further, from a time difference between the timings at which the contacts turn ON, a key depression speed can be detected, and musical sound to be generated can be controlled according to the detected key depression speed. 
   Next, since the keyboard apparatus  2  includes the mass members (generally called hammers) operating in linkage with the respective keys so as to provide a heavy touch feeling when the keys are depressed, the mass members will be described with reference to  FIG. 2 ,  FIG. 9  and  FIG. 10  in addition to  FIG. 1 . 
   The white key mass member  50 W for the each of white keys  20  and the black key mass member  50 B for the each of black keys  40  are mounted respectively on the mass member mounting part  10 G of the keyboard frame  10  to be pivotable in the arrow M direction in  FIG. 1 . 
   The white key mass members  50 W and the black key mass members  50 B have substantially the same structure as follows. In each of them, a pivot supported part  51 W or  51 B, the main driven part  53 W or  53 B, and the sub driven part  54 W or  54 B are integrally formed of resin to constitute a driving force transmitting part. A front end portion of an inertia moment generating part  52 W or  52 B made of a bar-shaped metal material such as an iron material is integrated with the pivot supported part  51 W or  51 B by outsert molding. 
   By a bending process, each rear end portion of the inertia moment generating part  52 W or  52 B is bent upward substantially at a right angle and further bent substantially at a right angle so as to return forward. The rear end portion of the inertia moment generating part  52 B of the black key mass member  50 B forms a C-shaped mass concentration part  52 Bc. The rear end portion of the inertia moment generating part  52 W of the white key mass member  50 W is further bent downward substantially at a right angle to form a mass concentration part  52 Wc in a substantially rectangular loop shape. 
   The mass concentration parts  52 Wc and  52 Bc extend more outward (backward) in the key longitudinal direction than the mass member upper limit stopper support part  10 H of the keyboard frame  10 , and at the highest lifted positions, that is, when the inertial moment generating parts  52 W,  52 B abut on the mass member upper limit stopper  83 , upper faces thereof become substantially flush with the upper faces of the key main bodies  43  of the white keys  20  or the upper faces of the thick connecting parts  42   a  of the black keys  40 . Portions in front of the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc in the inertia moment generating parts  52 W,  52 B are connecting parts connecting the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc to the driving force transmitting parts. 
   In the pivot supported parts  51 W,  51 B of the respective mass members  50 W,  50 B, provided are bearing parts  13 W,  13 B forming recessions in a radial direction and having guide tongue pieces Q which protrude backward from lower sides of the recessions. As shown also in  FIG. 9 , on an upper face of the mass member mounting part  10 G of the keyboard frame  10 , pairs of support ribs  10 W and pairs of support ribs  10 B parallel to the key longitudinal direction are integrally provided, the support ribs  10 W or  10 B in each pair facing at a predetermined interval in the key width direction, and each of pivotal shafts  14 W,  14 B is bridged between the pair of support ribs. As shown in  FIG. 2 , openings  38 ,  48  are formed in the mass member mounting part  10 G to allow mold dies to be put therein when the pivot shafts  14 W,  14 B are molded. In  FIG. 1 , the front-side support ribs of the pairs of support ribs  10 W are omitted. 
   The pivot shafts  14 W,  14 B are inserted in the recessions of the bearings  13 W,  13 B of the respective mass members  50 W,  50 B, so that the white key mass members  50 W are pivotably supported by the mass member mounting part  10 G via the bearing parts  13 W, the pivot shafts  14 W and the pairs of support ribs  10 W, and the black key mass members  50 B are pivotably supported by the mass member mounting part  10 G via the bearing parts  13 B, the pivot shafts  14 B and the pairs of support ribs  10 B. 
   The pivot support position, namely, the position of the pivot shafts  14 W in terms of the key longitudinal direction is different from that of the pivot shafts  14 B as is seen from  FIG. 2  and  FIG. 9 , and the pivot shafts  14 W for the white key mass members  50 W are positioned closer to a front end than the pivot shafts  14 B for the black key mass members  50 B. 
   As shown in  FIG. 1 , in front end portions of the white key mass members  50 W, the main driven parts  53 W and the sub driven parts  54 W are provided at an interval in the vertical direction to be integrated with the pivot supported parts  51 W, and the main driven parts  53 W protrude more forward than the sub driven parts  54 W. Further, as shown in  FIG. 1 , the mass driving parts  29  are provided on the lower faces near the rear end portions of wide portions shown in  FIG. 4  of the each of white keys  20  to protrude straight downward. Lower end faces of the mass member driving parts  29  abut on upper faces of the main driven parts  53 W of the corresponding white key mass members  50 W. Further, lower portions of the mass member driving parts  29  are hollow with rear faces thereof being open, and front end portions of the sub driven parts  54 W are loosely inserted in the hollow portions as shown by the broken line in  FIG. 1 . 
   With the above-described structure, a heavy touch feeling is given when the white key  20  is depressed, because the mass member driving part  29  goes down to drive the main driven part  53 W, so that the white key mass member  50 W pivots on the pivot shaft  14 W serving as a fulcrum, counter-clockwise in  FIG. 1  up to the position shown by the virtual line, at which time a part C of the inertia moment generating part  52 W abuts on the mass member upper limit stopper  83 . When the key release, a lower end inner wall of the mass member driving part  29  is engaged with and lifts the sub driven part  54 W, so that the white key mass member  50 W pivots clockwise in  FIG. 1  on the pivot shaft  14 W serving as a fulcrum to quickly return to the position shown by the solid line, at which time the mass concentration part  52 Wc abuts on the mass member lower limit stopper  84 . 
   In this manner, the mass member driving parts  29  are engaged with the main driven parts  53 W and the sub driven parts  54 W of the white key mass members  50 W so that the white keys  20  and the white key mass members  50 W always operate in linkage each other to pivot. 
   Similarly, in a front end portion of each of the black key mass members  50 B, the main driven part  53 B and the sub driven part  54 B shown by the virtual lines in  FIG. 10  are provided at an interval in the vertical direction to be integrated with the pivot supported part  51 B (see  FIG. 9 ), and the main driven part  53 B protrudes more to the front side than the sub driven part  54 B. Further, as shown in  FIG. 10 , on a bottom face of a front end portion of each of the black keys  40 , the mass member driving part  45  is protrudingly provided. The mass member driving part  45  is cranked downward, forward, and downward to have its lower end face  45   a  abut on an upper face of the main driven part  53 B of the corresponding black key mass member  50 B, and the position in the key longitudinal direction of the mass member driving part  45  is aligned with the position where the lower end face of the white key mass member driving part  29  abuts on the main driven part  53 W of the white key mass member  50 W, as shown by the virtual line in  FIG. 9 . 
   A lower end portion  45   a  of the mass member driving part  45  is also hollow, with a rear face thereof open, and a front end portion of the sub driven part  54 B is loosely inserted therein as shown by the virtual line in  FIG. 10 . 
   Consequently, similarly to the above-described case of the white keys  20  and the white key mass members  50 W, the black keys  40  and the black key mass members  50 B also always operate in linkage each other when pivoting. 
   In this embodiment, the mass member driving parts  45  extend forward under the white keys  20  as described above, so that the driving positions in the key longitudinal direction of the white key mass members  50 W and the black key mass members  50 B by the mass member driving parts  29 ,  45  of the white keys  20  and the black keys  40  become substantially the same. On the other hand, the positions in the key longitudinal direction of the pivot shafts  14 W and  14 B serving as pivotal fulcrums of the white key mass members  50 W and the black key mass members  50 B are different (they are staggered arrangement). 
   Therefore, the distance from points where the black key mass members  50 B are driven by the mass member driving parts  45  to the pivotal fulcrums are longer than the distance from points where the white key mass members  50 W are driven by the mass member driving parts  29  to the pivotal fulcrums, and the distance from the pivotal fulcrums of the inertia moment generating parts  52 B of the black key mass members  50 B to the parts C abutting on the mass member upper limit stopper  83  is shorter than the distance from the pivotal fulcrums of the inertia moment generating parts  52 W of the white key mass members  50 W to the parts C abutting on the mass member upper limit stopper  83 . This realizes good balance between the white keys  20  and the black keys  40  in terms of key depression feeling. 
   The following description will be on reasons why the white key mass members  50 W and the black key mass members  50 B in this embodiment are structured, as described above, such that the mass concentration parts  52 Wc and  52 Bc extend more outward (backward) in the key longitudinal direction than the mass member upper limit stopper support part  10 H of the keyboard frame  10 , and at the highest lifted position, namely, when the inertia moment generating parts  52 W,  52 B abut on the mass member upper limit stoppers  83 , the upper faces thereof become substantially flush with the upper faces of the key main bodies  43  of the white keys  20  or with the upper faces of the thick connecting parts  42   a  of the black keys  40 . 
   In a piano system keyboard apparatus with mass members (hammers), balancing with a mounting space is important for realizing a good key depression touch feeling. In particular, a musical instrument in a lower price range has a larger dimensional restriction of an instrument main body and thus involves a higher possibility that performance as a keyboard has to be sacrificed, and therefore, achieving the highest possible space efficiency under such a restriction is essential. Arranging the minimum necessary members and other functional components at the same height can eliminate an excessive space. What is especially important is that a movement amount of the mass members (hammers) almost determines the height of a unit. 
   Therefore, by making the mass concentration parts of the mass members extend more outward in the key longitudinal direction than the mass member upper limit stopper support part of the keyboard frame, it is possible to realize both improved equivalent mass and reduced weight of the mass members as well as resulting cost reduction. 
   Feeling of mass is proportional to a square of the distance from a pivotal fulcrum to a gravity center of a mass member, and therefore, the mass concentration part is preferably positioned as far as possible from the pivotal fulcrum. For this purpose, the mass concentration parts are made to protrude from the keyboard frame, and further upper ends of the mass concentration parts are positioned at the same height as the highest point of the keyboard frame and the keys when the mass members pivot upward. This makes it possible both to improve a touch feeling and to secure the scope for mounting at a higher level. 
   Further, in this embodiment, the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc of the mass members  50 W,  50 B are made of the bar-shaped metal members whose rear end portions are bent upward in the key depression/release direction and further bent toward the connection parts. This structure makes it possible to increase an inertia moment by increasing equivalent weight without making the whole length of the mass members  50 W,  50 B very long, leading to an improved touch feeling. In addition, since each of the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc is bent in a space having a width equal to the diameter of the bar-shaped metal member and parallel to the key depression/release direction, it is possible to avoid interference with the mass members of the adjacent keys and make efficient use of an upper space. 
   This bent shape of the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc is not limited to a C-shape or a rectangular shape but may be various shapes such as a U-shape, a triangular shape, a circular shape, and a spiral shape. 
   Further, in this embodiment, the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc of the white key mass members  50 W and the black key mass members  50 B are different in effective length (length when they are stretched=weight), so that the white keys  20  and the black keys  40  are equal in touch feeling. 
   Further, in the keyboard apparatus  2  of this embodiment, the components of the keyboard frame  10  are supported by the many ribs to be integrated as described in  FIG. 1 . Each of the largest ribs  10   d  among these ribs is provided between predetermined two adjacent mass members among the plural mass members  50 W,  50 B to be parallel to the longitudinal direction thereof. At least part of lower edges of the ribs  10   d  (middle portions along the key longitudinal direction of the ribs  10   d  in the example in  FIG. 1 ) are formed along lower edges of the mass members  50 W,  50 B when the mass members  50 W,  50 B are not driven and are in an inclined state with the mass concentration parts  52 Wc,  52 Bc being at the lowest descended position as shown by the solid line. This structure enables effective use of a space formed in a lower part of the keyboard frame  10 . For example, functional components and so on that are long in the arrangement direction of the keys and the mass members (key width direction) can be easily disposed. 
   In this case, the pivotal fulcrum portions by the bearing parts  13 W,  13 B of the mass members  50 W,  50 B and by the pivot shafts  14 W,  14 B on the mass member mounting part  10 G side are provided at a predeteremined height position from the lowest end of the keyboard frame  10  being the support member, whereby a space outside the movement range of the mass members  50 W,  50 B is formed under the mass members  50 W,  50 B, and the highest part of the space coincides with the lower edges of the ribs  10   d.    
   Moreover, a plurality of recessed portions  16 ,  18  recessed into this space are formed in the lower case  70  mounted on the lower end of the keyboard frame  10 , and the respective recessed portions  16 ,  18  can serve as functional component housing parts. In the example shown in  FIG. 1 , the recessed portion  18  is used as a battery chamber storing batteries or a battery pack, and a cover  75  is detachably provided therein. 
   With this structure, in a case of a portable electronic keyboard instrument, it is possible to put necessary batteries or a necessary battery pack containing batteries without providing extra space (without increasing the dimension in the height direction of the keyboard apparatus). 
   The other recessed portion  16  is used as a functional component housing part and various kinds of functional components that are long in the key arrangement direction can be stored therein. This functional component housing part can also be used as a part in which a temporary support member used when the keyboard frame  10  is fitted in the lower case  70  is inserted or as a part for storing accessories such as cords and microphones. 
   As the functional components, bending-preventive rigidity generating members (ribs, reinforcing members, and the like extending in the key arrangement direction) for increasing rigidity in the key arrangement direction of the keyboard apparatus also can be disposed under the lower edges of the ribs. 
   The lower case  70  is fixed to the boss parts  10   f ,  10   g ,  10   h  of the keyboard frame  10  with setscrews  72 ,  73 ,  74 . 
   It is also possible to integrate the keyboard frame  10  and the lower case  70  and make part of the lower case support the key unit and the mass members. 
   In this embodiment, only dispersed two or three places of the bottom face of the keyboard frame  10  constitute the lowest end of the keyboard frame  10  being the support member. In the example shown in  FIG. 1 , only the bottom faces of the boss parts  10   f ,  10   h  constitute the lowest end of the keyboard frame  10  and the other portions are higher than the lowest end. For example, a bottom face of the boss part  10   g  is slightly higher than the bottom face of the boss part  10   f . When two places constitute the lowest end, at least one of them needs to have a certain length to produce a state similar to three-point support. 
   With this structure, the keyboard apparatus  2  does not wobble and can be stably set when it is directly placed on a key bed of a keyboard instrument without mounting the lower case  70 . 
   Here, the relation between the shape of the ribs of the keyboard frame and the lower case in the keyboard apparatus shown in  FIG. 1  will be described with reference to  FIG. 11  in an easy-to-understand way.  FIG. 11  shows a cross section taken along a different position in the key arrangement direction from that in  FIG. 1 , with the keyboard frame  1  and the lower case  70  being shown in a vertically separated manner. The mass members and the pivot shafts for the white key and the black key are not discriminated by different reference symbols, but “W” and “B” are excluded from the reference numerals used in the above-described drawings to denote them. The same reference symbols as those in  FIG. 1  are used to denote the other portions corresponding to those in  FIG. 1 , and description thereof will be omitted. 
   The plural mass members  50  are pivotably mounted on the mass member mounting part  10 G that is positioned at a predetermined height from the lowest end of the keyboard frame  10  being the support member, with the bearing parts  13  of the pivot supported parts  51  being supported by the pivot shafts  14  provided between the pair of support ribs  10 W (the support rib  10 W on the near side is removed in  FIG. 11 ) formed in the mass member mounting part  10 G. The inertia moment generating parts  52  made of the bar-shaped metal material extend in the longitudinal direction of the not-shown keys and each has the mass concentration part  52   c  in its rear end portion. At the non-driven time when the main driven part  53  and the sub driven part  54  are not driven by the key, the mass member  50  is in an inclined state where the mass concentration part  52   c  is at the lowest descended position as shown in  FIG. 11 . 
   The keyboard frame  10  being the support member has the ribs  10   d  each provided between predeteremined two adjacent mass members  50  among the plural mass members  50 , and at least part of a lower edge Re of the rib  10   d  is formed along (at the same height as) a lower edge Me of the mass member  50  which is not driven and thus in the inclined state. 
   The pivot shaft  14  being the pivotal fulcrum part of the mass member  50  is provided between the support ribs  10 W on the mass member mounting part  10 G that is at the predetermined height position from the lowest end (bottom faces of the boss parts  10   f ,  10   h ) of the keyboard frame  10 . Therefore, a space S outside a movement range of the mass members  50  is formed thereunder, and an upper most portion of the space S coincides with part of the lower edges Re of the ribs  10   d.    
   The lower case  70  mounted on the lower end of the keyboard frame  10  has the plural recessed portions  16 ,  18  recessed into the space S to serve as functional component housing parts. For example, the recessed portion  18  can be used as a battery housing part housing batteries or a battery pack and the other recessed portion  16  can be used as an accessory housing part storing accessories such as cords or microphones. 
     FIG. 12  and  FIG. 13  are schematic side views showing other usage examples of the space under the mass members of the keyboard apparatus according to the invention. In these drawings, which show the keyboard apparatus shown in  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 11  in a simplified manner, the same reference symbols are used to designate components corresponding to those in  FIG. 1  and  FIG. 11 , and description thereof will be omitted. As in  FIG. 11 , the mass members for the white keys and the black keys are not discriminated by different reference symbols but reference symbols without “W” and “B” are used to denote them. Reference numeral  5  denotes a key pivoting part coupling the white key  20  or the black key  40  pivotably to the keyboard frame  10 . 
     FIG. 12  shows an example where a printed circuit board  6  constituting an electronic circuit such as an amplifier is disposed in the space under the mass members  50 , and the printed circuit board  6 , even if long in the key arrangement direction, can be easily disposed without any interference by the many ribs  10   d.    
     FIG. 13  shows an example where speakers  7  are disposed in the space under the mass members  50 , and the plural speakers  7  can be arranged in arbitrary positions in the key arrangement direction. In this case, the keyboard apparatus is applied to a console-type electronic keyboard instrument, and tone emission holes are formed in a key bed of the keyboard instrument so that sound is emitted downward from the key bed. 
   In any of these cases, the printed circuit board  6  or the speakers  7  do not protrude from the lowest end of the keyboard frame  10 . Nor do they interfere with the ascending/descending movement of the inertia moment generating part  52   c  when the mass members  50  pivot. 
   The invention is applicable not only to electronic keyboard instruments but also to electric keyboard instruments using acoustic sound generators and other keyboard instruments including mass members. It goes without saying that the shapes and arrangements of the components are not limited to those in the embodiment, but may be appropriately changed according to the specifications of musical instruments to which the invention is applied. 
   The keyboard apparatus according to the invention is applicable to various kinds of keyboard instruments, for example, electronic keyboard instruments such as electronic organs, electronic pianos, and synthesizers, and electric keyboard instruments. In particular, the keyboard apparatus according to the invention is suitably applicable to a small-type electronic keyboard instrument including mass members (hammers) for respective keys, and it is possible to provide a high-performance, compact electronic keyboard instrument with a good key touch feeling at low cost.","1.

   1. Field of the Invention 
   The present invention relates to an easy-pull type swivel plug, and in particular to an easy-pull type swivel plug that supplies the electricity to electrical appliances and can be unplugged easily. 
   2. Description of Related Art 
   A plug is a necessary component for supplying the electricity to electrical appliances. The power of various electrical appliances is delivered from the plug and a power supply line. Therefore, the manufacturer and researcher pay more and more attention to the improvement of the plug. 
   As for conventional plugs, Taiwan Patent Publication No. M277125 published on 1 Oct. 2005 discloses a plug having a pull ring, which includes a hollow casing, at least two conductive pieces, a lead, a pull ring and two pivoting pieces. The casing has two connecting portions opposite to each other. The two conductive pieces are disposed in the casing. The lead is disposed in the casing and connected to the conductive pieces. The pull ring has a U shape and both ends thereof have a pivoting hole respectively. The pull ring straddles on the casing, so that the two pivoting holes correspond to the two connecting portions. The two pivoting pieces penetrate movably through the two pivoting holes of the pull ring with one end thereof being combined with one connecting portion of the casing. The other end of each pivoting piece has a stopping portion. The diameter of the stopping portion is larger than that of the pivoting hole. 
   However, the pull ring of the above-mentioned conventional plug has a U shape with both ends thereof being combined on two opposing lateral surfaces of the casing. Therefore, when a user pulls the pull ring to unplug, the tension force exerted by the user may be distributed on both lateral surfaces of the casing without concentrating, and thus the plug cannot be unplugged easily. 
   Further, the number of the components used between the casing and the pull ring is so many that it is inconvenient to assemble them together, increasing the production cost. 
   Therefore, in view of the above the drawbacks, the inventor proposes the present invention to overcome the above problems based on his deliberate research. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   The primary object of the present invention is to provide an easy-pull type swivel plug, whereby the user can unplug it with less labor and the deformation of the conductive pieces can be avoided. 
   In order to achieve the above object, the present invention provides an easy-pull type swivel plug, which includes a body; a rotatable disk rotatably provided on one side of the body, the rotatable disk being provided with at least two conductive pieces, the two conductive pieces extending beyond the body; and a handle pivoted to the other side of the body opposite to the rotatable disk in a liftable and foldable manner, the pivoting position between the handle and body corresponding to the center of the rotatable disk. 
   The present invention has the following effect. The rotatable disk of the present invention can drive the two conductive pieces to rotate in the range of 360 degrees. The degree of rotation can be adjusted according to different conditions and orientations, thereby making the usage of the plug more flexible. Further, the pivoting position between the handle and body corresponds to the center of the rotatable disk. In this way, the deformation of the conductive pieces caused by a torque generated in misalignment with the center can be avoided and the user can unplug more easily with less labor. 
   In order to further understand the technique, method and effects employed in the present invention to achieve the desired objects, a detailed description relating thereto will be made with reference to the accompanying drawings, thereby verifying the objects, characteristics and features of the present invention. However, it should be understood that the drawings are illustrative only but not used to limit the present invention. 


   
     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
   Please refer to  FIGS. 1 to 3 . The present invention provides an easy-pull type swivel plug that can be inserted into a socket (not shown) of utility power supply. The easy-pull type swivel plug includes a body  10 , a rotatable disk  20 , a handle  30  and a power supply line  40 . The body  10  is made of insulating materials and is flat. One side of the body  10  is provided with a circular accommodating trough  11  ( FIG. 3 ) for accommodating the rotatable disk  20 . 
   The rotating disk  20  is made of insulating materials and has a circular shape ( FIG. 3 ). The rotatable disk  20  is rotatably provided in the accommodating trough  11  on one side of the body  10 , so that the rotatable disk  20  can rotate in the range of 360 degrees with respect to the body  10 . The connecting structure of the rotatable disk  20  and the body  10  is familiar to those skilled in the art, and the present invention does not intend to limit the connecting structure to the illustrative form. Thus, the description thereof is omitted. 
   In the present embodiment, the rotatable disk  20  is fixedly provided with two conductive pieces  21 . However, the number of the conductive pieces  21  is not limited thereto and can be three or other suitable number. The two conductive pieces  21  are made of conductive metal and extend beyond the body  10 . 
   The front half portion of the other side of the body  10  opposite to the rotatable disk  20  has a first connecting portion  12 . In the present embodiment, the first connecting portion  12  is a trough, but not limited thereto. The position of the first connecting portion  12  corresponds to the center of the rotatable disk  20 . Further, the two opposing inner walls of the first connecting portion  12  (i.e. trough) are provided with a first pivoting portion  13  respectively ( FIG. 1 ). In the present embodiment, the first pivoting portion  13  is a pivoting shaft. 
   The rear half portion of the other side of the body  10  opposite to the rotatable disk  20  is provided with an accommodating space  14  for accommodating the handle  30 . 
   The handle  30  comprises a ring portion  31  and a second connecting portion  32 . The ring portion  31  is provided with a penetrating hole  311  for allowing a finger to be disposed therein. In the present embodiment, the second connecting portion  32  is a protruding block that is formed by protruding forwardly from the front side of the ring portion  31 , but it is not limited thereto. The two opposing side walls of the second connecting portion  32  are provided with two second pivoting portions  33  to correspond to the two first pivoting portions  13  of the first connecting portion  12  ( FIG. 1 ). In the present embodiment, the second pivoting portion  33  is a pivoting hole. 
   Alternatively, the first pivoting portion  13  can be a pivoting hole, and the second pivoting portion  33  is a pivoting shaft (not shown). Via this arrangement, the pivoting effect can be also achieved. 
   The power supply line  40  is connected to the rear end of the body  10 . One end of the power supply line  40  penetrates into the body  10  and is connected electrically to the two conductive pieces  21 . 
   In assembly, the second connecting portion  32  (i.e. the protruding block) of the handle  30  is accommodated in the first connecting portion  12  (i.e. the trough) of the body  10 . Further, the two first pivoting portions  13  (i.e. the pivoting shafts) of the first connecting portion  12  are inserted into the two second pivoting portions  33  (i.e. the pivoting holes) of the second connecting portion  32 , so that the second connecting portion  32  can be pivoted to the first connecting portion  12 . In this way, the handle  30  can be pivoted to the other side of the body  10  opposite to the rotatable disk  20  in a liftable and foldable manner. Also, the pivoting position between the handle  30  and the body  10  corresponds to the center of the rotatable disk  20 . Via the above constitution, the easy-pull type swivel plug of the present invention can be obtained. 
   Please refer to  FIG. 4 . Since the handle  30  of the present invention can be rotatably pivoted to the body  10 , the handle  30  can rotate 90 degrees when the handle  30  is lifted, thereby obtaining an orientation perpendicular to the body  10 . 
   When the easy-pull type swivel plug of the present invention is to be unplugged, the user only needs to lift the handle  30  and then put his/her finger into the penetrating hole  311  of the handle  30 , so that the plug can be pulled out of the socket easily with less labor. 
   Further, when the handle  30  is not in use, the user can fold the handle  30 , so that the handle  30  can be accommodated in the accommodating space  14  ( FIG. 2 ), thereby saving the space. 
   Therefore, via the easy-pull type swivel plug of the present invention, the following features and effects can be achieved. 
   1. The rotatable disk  20  of the present invention is pivoted to the body  10  and is able to drive two conductive pieces  21  to rotate in the range of 360 degrees. Therefore, it is convenient for the user to adjust the degree of rotation according to different conditions and orientations, thereby making the usage of the plug more flexible. 
   2. The pivoting position between the handle  30  and the body  10  corresponds to the center of the rotatable disk  20 . Therefore, the user can concentrate his force on the center of the rotatable disk  20 , thereby avoiding the deformation of the conductive pieces  21  caused by a torque generated in misalignment with the center. Further, this feature allows the user to unplug more easily with less labor. 
   3. The handle  30  of the present invention is provided with a penetrating hole  311 . Therefore, the user can put his/her finger into the penetrating hole  311  to facilitate the unplugging operation. 
   4. When not in use, the handle  30  of the present invention can be accommodated in the accommodating space  14  of the body  10 , thereby saving the space. 
   5. The handle  30  of the present invention is pivoted to the body  10  directly. Therefore, the structure is simpler and the assembling process is easier. As a result, the production cost can be reduced. 
   Although the present invention has been described with reference to the foregoing preferred embodiment, it will be understood that the invention is not limited to the details thereof. Various equivalent variations and modifications can still occur to those skilled in this art in view of the teachings of the present invention. Thus, all such variations and equivalent modifications are also embraced within the scope of the invention as defined in the appended claims.","1. An easy-pull type swivel plug, comprising:

US-7338315-B2,"The invention relates to a closure device comprising a wall, an opening provided in this wall, a flap which selectively adopts at least one closed position in which it blocks the opening and an open position in which it uncovers this opening. Pins are connected to a first edge of the flap, and recesses provided in the thickness of the wall on either side of the opening to receive the pins. 
     The device of the invention also comprises flexible arms which connect the pins to the first edge of the flap in an elastic manner in the direction of bringing the pins towards one another. These arms protrude from the first edge and from the rear face of this flap.","FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
   The invention relates in general to the design of closure systems with movable flaps, in particular for electrical sockets or computer sockets. 
   More specifically, the invention relates to a closure device comprising a wall having a front face and a rear face, an opening provided in this wall, a flap having a front face and a rear face which selectively adopts at least one of a closed position in which it blocks the opening and an open position in which it uncovers this opening, pins connected to a first edge of the flap, and recesses provided in the thickness of the wall on either side of the opening to receive the pins, these recesses cooperating with the pins to hold the flap relative to the wall at least in its closed position. 
   BACKGROUND 
   In the known devices of this type, the pins are generally formed on either side of the flap close to the first edge of the latter. 
   This solution requires the use of relatively flexible materials, as a result of which the pins are subject to rapid wear, even when the device is produced with very strict manufacturing tolerances. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   The invention, which falls within this context, has the aim of providing a closure device which is free of this constraint regarding the choice of materials. 
   The device of the invention, which is of the type of the generic definition given in the preamble above, also comprises flexible arms which connect the pins to the first edge of the flap, biasing the pins towards one another, these arms protruding from the first edge and from the rear face of this flap. 
   It is also possible to provide that the device of the invention comprises a separating part arranged close to a first edge of the opening, adjacent to the first edge of the flap when this flap is in the closed position, that this separating part defines a retraction slot inside this opening, and that the flap can also move from its open position to a retracted position by sliding inside the retraction slot. 
   It may also be judicious to provide that the arms have a bayonet profile, that the recesses are hollowed out in the rear face of the wall beyond the slot with respect to the separating part, and that the flap passes from its closed position to its open position by tilting the rear face of the flap on the front edge of the separating part, inserting the first edge of the flap into the slot, and at the same time releasing the pins from the recesses. 
   Preferably, the pins have outer faces which slope towards a median plane of the flap, and the recesses are bordered by reliefs which each have a gentle slope in a direction of insertion of the pins and a steep slope in a direction of extraction of the pins, the flap thus being non-removable. 
   In the device of the invention, the wall may be made of a thermosetting polymer, while the flap, the arms and the pins may be made of polycarbonate.

   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
   As mentioned above, the invention relates to a closure device comprising in particular a wall  1 , an opening  2  provided in the wall  1 , a flap  3 , pins  4  connected to the edge  31  of the flap  3  conventionally defined as the upper edge of this flap, and recesses  5  designed to receive the pins  4 . 
   The flap  3  is mounted to move with respect to the wall  1  and can at least adopt, at will, a closed position in which it blocks the opening  2  ( FIG. 10A ) and an open position in which it uncovers this opening  2  ( FIG. 10E ). 
   The wall  1  and the flap  3  have respective front faces  101  and  301  and respective rear faces  102  and  302 , only the front faces  101  and  301  being visible from the exterior of the device when the flap  3  is in its closed position. 
   The recesses  5  are provided in the thickness of the wall  1  on either side of the opening  2  to receive the pins  4  which cooperate with these recesses  5  to hold the flap  3  relative to the wall  1  at least in its closed position. 
   As shown in particular in  FIGS. 2 and 3 , the device of the invention also comprises flexible arms  6  which connect the pins  4  to the upper edge  31  of the flap  3  and which protrude from this edge  31  and from the rear face  302  of the flap  3 . 
   The arms  6  are flexible in a direction transverse to the median plane P of the flap  3  so that they make it possible, via the application of an elastic force, to bring the pins  4  together and move them apart. 
   A retraction slot  20  may be defined inside the opening  2  by means of a separating part  7  which is arranged parallel to the upper edge  21  of this opening, that is to say parallel to the edge of the opening which is adjacent to the upper edge  31  of the flap  3  when this flap is in the closed position. 
   The flap  3  can thus be moved not just between its closed position and its open position, but also from its open position to a retracted position ( FIG. 10F ) and vice versa, the flap  3  reaching its retracted position by sliding inside the retraction slot  20 . 
   The arms  6  preferably have a bayonet profile ( FIGS. 10C to 10E ), and the recesses  5  are hollowed out in the rear face  102  of the wall  1  beyond the slot  20  with respect to the separating part  7 . 
   Thus, as shown in the succession of  FIGS. 10A to 100 , the flap  3  passes from its closed position to its open position by tilting the rear face  302  of the flap  3  on the front edge  71  of the separating part  7 , at the same time inserting the upper edge  31  of the flap  3  into the slot  20 , and at the same time releasing the pins  4  from the recesses  5 . 
   As can best be seen from  FIG. 3 , the pins  4  have outer faces  41  which slope towards the median plane P of the flap  3 . 
   In a corresponding manner ( FIGS. 8 and 9 ), the recesses  5  are bordered by reliefs  51  which each have a gentle slope  511  in a direction X+ of insertion of the pins  4  and a steep slope  512  in a direction X− of extraction of the pins  4  from these recesses. 
   When the flap  3  is placed in the opening  2  ( FIGS. 6 and 7 ), the meeting of the inclined faces  41  of the pins  4  and of the slopes  511  of the reliefs  51  elastically biases these pins together by flexion of the arms  6 , and then the pins  4  snap into the recesses  5 . 
   Since the edges of the pins  4  are then opposite the steep slopes  512  of the recesses  5 , these pins are held captive and the flap  3  is rendered non-removable. 
   The invention can be used in particular in the case where the wall  1  is made of a thermosetting polymer, while the flap  3 , the arms  6  and the pins  4  are made of polycarbonate.","1. A closure device comprising:

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
   Referring to  FIGS. 1  to  3 , the air compressor with shock-absorption rubber strips at a bottom thereof of the present invention is illustrated. The air compressor with shock-absorption rubber strips at a bottom thereof includes an air compressor  1  and at least one shock-absorption rubber strip  2  or  2   a.    
   The air compressor  1  is a conventional air compressor with an electromotive device therein. The outer side of the air compressor  1  is installed with a pressure indicator  11  or an illuminator  12 . 
   The shock-absorption rubber strip  2  or  2   a  is made of elastic rubbers, which may be a single close striped frame as shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2  (or a single non-closed striped frame), or may be formed by two separated stripped frame (referring to FIG.  3 ). Each shock-absorption rubber strip  2  or  2   a  encloses in the sidewall of the air compressor bottom plate  13  (referring to FIG.  4 ), as shown in the figure. The side wall of shock-absorption rubber strip  2  or  2   a  installed with the air compressor bottom plate  13  have matched embedded groove  21  or  21   a  so that the engagement can be executed easily. Likewise, other than above said engagement, other ways, such as locking or gluing can be used to achieve the same effect. 
   The elastic shock-absorption rubber strip  2  or  2   a  is installed to the air compressor bottom plate  13 , so that when the air compressor  1  is actuated, the shock-absorption rubber strip  2  or  2   a  will absorb the vibration of the casing of the air compressor  1  so as to assure that the air compressor  1  is stood at the original place. Thereby, the air compressor  1  will not displace as it is started. 
   Referring to  FIGS. 5 and 6 , another embodiment of the shock-absorption rubber strip  2   b  of the present invention is illustrated. In that a lower end of the shock-absorption rubber strip and a selected lateral side are integrally formed with a frame seat  22   b  and at least one food pad  23   b  so that the shock-absorption rubber strip  2   b  can be fixed and combined to the lateral wall of the air compressor bottom plate  13 . In another case, as shown in FIG.  17 , other than the shock-absorption rubber strip and a selected lateral side being integrally formed with a frame seat  22   c  and at least one food pad  23   c , the frame seat  22   c  may have a hollow structure (referring to  FIGS. 5 and 6 , in that the frame seat  22  has a solid structure). 
   Likewise, the shock-absorption rubber strip  2   b  or  2   c  may be locked or sticky to the air compressor bottom plate  13  other than fixing by embedding so as to achieve the same effect.

     SUMMARY OF INVENTION 
     Technical Problem 
     In recent years, agrochemicals having growth promoting effect on crops, etc. (plant growth regulators) have been tried out with the aim of sound growth and yield increase of crops. However, conventional plant growth regulators are disadvantageous in that the plant growth regulating effect is insufficient in some kinds of crops, some growing conditions, etc. and therefore novel plant growth regulators are still desired. 
     Solution to Problem 
     In order to develop novel plant growth regulators, the present inventors have investigated the effect of various compounds on plant growth regulation. As a result, the present inventors have found that a known agricultural and horticultural insecticide flubendiamide has an excellent plant growth regulating effect and completed the present invention. 
     That is, the present invention relates to the following.
     [1] A plant growth regulator comprising flubendiamide as an active ingredient.   [2] A method for using a plant growth regulator, comprising treatment of target crops or soil in the vicinity of the target crops with the plant growth regulator according to the above [1].   [3] The method according to the above [2], wherein the treatment is spray treatment of the target crops, or spray treatment or drench treatment of the soil in the vicinity of the target crops.   [4] A method for increasing the yield of target crops, comprising treatment of target crops or soil in the vicinity of the target crops with the plant growth regulator according to the above [1].   [5] A method for promoting the growth of target crops, comprising treatment of target crops or soil in the vicinity of the target crops with the plant growth regulator according to the above [1].   

     Advantageous Effects of Invention 
     According to the present invention, the plant growth regulator and the method for using the same can promote sound growth of crops and produce excellent plant growth regulating effects on the crops, including rooting promotion; earlier initiation of rooting; increase of the numbers of leaves, stems, panicles and unhulled rice grains; promotion of tillering; plant height growth; stem enlargement; growth promotion; increase of resistance to drought, salts, low temperatures and high temperatures; reduction of lower leaf senescence; and coloring and ripening acceleration, sugar content increase, quality improvement, yield increase, etc. of harvestable plant parts of fruits, cereals, potatoes, legumes, etc. Further, the plant growth regulator and the method for using the same can utilize the previously known effect of flubendiamide as an agricultural and horticultural insecticide, and thus are also remarkably effective for control of insect pests such as Lepidopteran insect pests.

     In the plant growth regulator of the present invention and the method for using the same, target crops may be any kinds of useful crops, and the examples include, but are not limited to, cereals such as rice, barley, wheat, rye, oats, corn and sorghum; legumes such as soybeans, azuki beans, broad beans, green peas and peanuts; fruit trees and fruits such as apples, citrus fruits, pears, grapes, peaches, plums, cherries, walnuts, almonds, bananas and strawberries; vegetables such as cabbages, tomatoes, spinach, broccoli, lettuce, onions, welsh onions and green peppers; root vegetables such as carrots, potatoes, sweet potatoes, Japanese radishes, lotus roots and turnips; crops for processing such as cotton, hemp, paper mulberry, oriental paperbush, rapeseeds, beet, hops, sugarcane, sugar beet, olives, rubber, coffee, tobacco and tea; gourd such as Japanese pumpkins, cucumbers, watermelons and melons; pasture grass such as orchardgrass, sorghum, timothy, clover and alfalfa; lawn grass such as Korean lawn grass and bent grass; spice and aromatic crops such as lavender, rosemary, thyme, parsley, pepper and ginger; and herbs. 
     In the method of the present invention for using the plant growth regulator or for regulating plant growth, the above-described formulation containing flubendiamide may be used as it is or used after appropriately diluted or suspended in water etc. The desired plant growth regulating effect can be obtained by, for example, spray treatment (onto foliage etc.), coating treatment or injection treatment of target crops; spray treatment or drench treatment of the soil in the vicinity of target crops; or seed treatment (dust coating, dipping, etc.) of target crops with the use of an effective amount of the optionally diluted or suspended formulation. In the case of paddy-field rice, submerged treatment in paddy fields, nursery box treatment, etc. can also be performed with granules and the like. The time of treatment is, for example, sometime during the period from seed treatment to before seeding, or the time when crops have grown to some extent after seeding, and at any stage, the desired plant growth regulating effect can be obtained. However, the best time is selected depending on the kind of target crop and the intended plant growth regulating effect. To attain the goal of yield increase, the time of treatment is preferably at one month before harvest or earlier, and in the case of cereals such as rice and wheat, the time of treatment is preferably before heading. 
     The amount of the plant growth regulator used for treatment is appropriately adjusted depending on various factors, for example, the purpose, the kind of target crop, the crop growing conditions, the weather, the environmental conditions, the formulation, the application method, the application site, the application time, etc. For example, in the case where target crops are subjected to spray treatment, the amount of flubendiamide is in the range of about 20 to 500 g/ha; and in the case where the soil in the vicinity of target crops is subjected to drench treatment, the amount of flubendiamide is in the range of about 10 to 300 g/ha. When the amount used for treatment is within the above range, the plant growth regulating effect of the plant growth regulator of the present invention can be more preferably exerted. 
     In recent years, genetically modified crops (e.g., herbicide-tolerant crops, insect pest-resistant transgenic crops producing insecticidal proteins, disease-resistant transgenic crops producing inducers of disease resistance, palatability-enhanced crops, long-term preservable crops, high-yield crops, etc.) and IPM (integrated pest management) technology using insect sex pheromones (e.g., communication disrupting agents against Tortricidae and Hadeninae, etc.), natural enemy insects, etc. have made progress, and these technologies and the agrochemical composition of the present invention can be used in combination or used systematically. 
     The plant growth regulator of the present invention can be used simultaneously with agricultural and horticultural microbicides, agricultural and horticultural insecticides, agricultural and horticultural herbicides, synergists, phytotoxicity reducers, etc. for control of diseases/insect pests, weeds, etc. which may spread in the period for the application of the plant growth regulator, enhanced effects, reduced phytotoxicity to crops, and other purposes.

     Test Example 1 
     Effect on Increase in Stem Number (Promotion of Tillering) of Paddy Rice Plants 
     Paddy rice plants were transplanted to an experimental paddy field (50 m 2 , planted with 1250 paddy rice plants on average), and 10 days later, granules containing flubendiamide as an active ingredient were applied once at the predetermined doses. At 43 days after the transplantation, in 10 rice plants chosen at random, the percentage of  Scirpophaga incertulas -caused dead hearts per plant, the percentage of control of  Scirpophaga incertulas,  the stem number per plant, and the percentage of increase in the stem number were measured. To exclude the positive effect of the insecticidal action of flubendiamide on the growth of paddy rice plants, chlorantraniliprole, which has an equivalent insecticidal action, was used as a control agrochemical. The results are shown in Table 1.

     As shown in Table 1, flubendiamide treatment and chlorantraniliprole treatment produced comparable results in terms of the percentage of  Scirpophaga incertulas -caused dead hearts per plant and the percentage of control of  Scirpophaga incertulas.  If flubendiamide had not had plant growth regulating effect, both treatments would not have differed so much from each other in the increase in stem number per plant from the non-treatment level. In the chlorantraniliprole treatment plot, the stem number per plant was increased by about four compared with the non-treatment level, and the percentage of increase was about 120%. Meanwhile, in the flubendiamide treatment plots, regardless of dose, the stem numbers per plant were increased by about 17 compared with the non-treatment level, and the percentages of increase were about 170 to 180%. Thus, flubendiamide clearly showed a significant effect on the increase in stem number. These results suggest that chlorantraniliprole induced the increase in the stem number by controlling  Scirpophaga incertulas,  which may damage the stems of rice plants, while flubendiamide exerted plant growth regulating effect in addition to control effect on  Scirpophaga incertulas,  thereby promoted tillering of paddy rice plants and induced the increase in the stem number. The increase in the stem number induced by flubendiamide leads to the increase in harvest, namely, rice yield. 
     Test Example 2 
     Effect on Rooting Promotion and Plant Height Growth in Paddy Rice Plants 
     A 0.7% agar solution containing 25 ppm of flubendiamide was poured into a glass cylinder (3 cm diameter×10 cm) and allowed to be solidified. Onto the solidified agar, ten germinating rice seeds (variety: Nihonbare) were sown. Then, the top of the cylinder was covered with Japanese paper and the cylinder was placed in a thermostatic chamber (light-dark cycle: 16 hours of light and 8 hours of dark, relative humidity: 60 to 70%) at 25° C. At 8 days after the seeding, the lengths of the longest root (primary root) and the stem-and-leaf part extending from each seed-rice were measured and the averages were calculated. The percentages of elongation were also calculated with the proviso that the non-treatment levels were set as 100. The results are shown in Table 2.

     Since Test Example 2 was a laboratory test, there was no influence of insect pests and therefore the pure plant growth regulating effect of flubendiamide was shown. As shown in the results in Table 2, the effect of flubendiamide on root and stem-and-leaf elongation was observed, and the percentages of elongation in root and stem-and-leaf lengths were 160% and 170% of the non-treatment levels, respectively. Therefore, flubendiamide has an excellent plant growth regulating effect. 
     Test Example 3 
     Effect on Yield Increase (Increase in Numbers of Panicles and Unhulled Rice Grains) of Paddy Rice Plants 
     Rice plants (variety: Takanari) of the 6.5- to 7-leaf stage were transplanted to 1-m 2  plots of a paddy field, and 2 or 12 days later, flubendiamide granules were applied at the predetermined doses. The test was performed in 4 replications. At 100 days after the transplantation, the rice plants were harvested, the numbers of panicles and unhulled rice grains per plant were measured and the averages were calculated. The percentages of increase were also calculated with the proviso that the non-treatment levels were set as 100. The results are shown in Table 3.

A pretreatment laundering process using the composition is also disclosed.","FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates to aqueous, heavy duty liquid laundry detergent compositions containing a lipolytic enzyme (lipase) and specially selected soap. The compositions provide enhanced cleaning of grease/oil soils and stains, particularly when used in a pre-treat laundering process for cleaning fabrics stained with grease/oil soils. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The detergent industry has a number of surfactant-related needs, including effective surface-active properties. The surfactants wet surfaces, reduce surface and interfacial tensions, disperse, solubilize and emulsify. All of these may be critical to the desired performance of the final detergent product. In addition, the increased use of liquid detergents and the complexity of these formulations increase the need for compatible surfactants and other detergent ingredients. Furthermore, the detergent ingredients need to be safe with respect to human exposure and long-term environmental impact. 
     It has been surprisingly found that the inclusion of specially selected soap materials into liquid detergent compositions containing a lipolytic enzyme (lipase) substantially enhances their ability to rapidly lower the interfacial tension of aqueous washing liquors containing greasy and oily soils. This substantial reduction of interfacial tension of greasy and oily soils improves their removal from soiled surfaces and inhibits the redeposition of the soils onto substrates. 
     It has also been suprisingly found that liquid detergent compositions containing a lipolytic enzyme and a specially selected soap material provide enhanced removal of greasy/oily soils particularly when the detergent composition is used in a pre-treatment application to greasy/oily soil stains on fabrics prior to and in conjunction with a normal wash process of the fabrics. 
     Moreover, it has been found that certain soaps, e.g. secondary alkyl carboxyls, not only provide the desired lowering of interfacial tension, with its attendant increase in grease removal performance, but also allow the formulation of liquid detergent compositions containing a lipase which are stable and homogeneous. In addition, it has been found that liquid detergent compositions comprising the specifically selected soaps are very useful when said lipase-containing liquid detergents are in direct contact with the greasy/oily satins and/or soils on fabrics such as during pretreatment. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention encompasses aqueous, heavy duty liquid laundry detergent compositions comprising:

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     Selected Secondary Soaps 
     The term &#34;specially selected soaps&#34; (a.k.a. &#34;alkyl carboxyl surfactants&#34;) herein encompasses a soap selected from the groups consisting off 
     A) C 8  -C 24  secondary carboxyl materials of the formula R 3  CH(R 4 )COOM, wherein R 3  is CH 3  (CH 2 ) x  and R 4  is CH 3  (CH 2 ) y , wherein y can be 0 or an integer from 1 to 10, x is an integer from 4 to 20 and the sum of (x+y) is 4-20, preferably 9-16, most preferably 11-14. 
     B) Carboxyl compounds wherein the carboxyl substituent is on a ring hydrocarbyl unit, i.e. secondary soaps of the formula R 5  -R 6  -COOM, wherein R 5  is C 7  -C 16 , preferably C 10  -C 13 , alkyl or alkenyl and R 6  is a ring structure, such as benzene, cyclopentane, cyclohexane and the like. (Note: R 5  can be in the ortho, meta or para position relative to the carboxyl on the ring). 
     C) C 10  -C 24  primary and secondary carboxyl compounds of the formula R 7  CH(R 8 )COOM, wherein the sum of the carbons in R 7  and R 8  is 8-22, R 7  is of the form CH 3  --(CHR 9 ) x  and R 8  is of the form H--(CHR 9 )y, where x and y are integers in the range 0-15 and R 9  is H or a C 1-4  linear or branched alkyl group. R 9  can be any combination of H and C 1-4  linear or branched alkyl group members within a single --(CHR 9 )x,y group; however, each molecule in this class must contain at least one R 9  that is not H. These types of molecules can be made by numerous methods, e.g. by hydroformylation and oxidation of branched olefins, hydroxycarboxylation of branched olefins, oxidation of the products of Guerbet reaction involving branched oxoalcohols. The branched olefins can be derived by oligomerization of shorter olefins, e.g. butene, isobutylene, branched hexene, propylene and pentene. 
     D) C 10  -C 24  tertiary carboxyl compounds, e.g. neo-acids, of the formula R 10  CR 11  (R 12 )COOM, wherein the sum of the carbons in R 10 , R 11  and R 12  is 8-22. R 10 , R 11  and R 12  are of the form CH 3  --(CHR 13 ) x , where x is an integer in the range 0-19, and R 13  is H or a C 1-4  linear of branched alkyl group. Not that R 13  can be any combination of H and C 1-4  linear or branched alkyl group members within a single --(CHR 13 ) x  group. These types of molecules result from addition of a carboxyl group to a branched olefin, e.g. by the Koch reaction. Commercial examples include the neodecanoic acid manufactured by Exxon, and the Versatic™ acids manufactured by Shell. 
     In each of the above formulas A, B, C and D, the species M can be any suitable, especially water-solubilizing, counterion, e.g. H, alkali metal, alkaline earth metal, ammonium, alkanolammonium, di- and tri- alkanolammonium, C1-C5 alkyl substituted ammonium and the like. Sodium is convenient, as is diethanolammonium. 
     Formula C class soaps comprise secondary carboxyl compounds of the formula CH 3  (CHR) k  --(CH 2 ) m  --(CHR) n  --CH(COOM)(CHR) o  --(CH 2 ) p  --(CHR) q  --CH 3 , wherein each R is C 1  -C 4  alkyl, wherein k, n, o, q are integers in the range of 0-2, provided that the total number of carbon atoms (including the carboxylate) is in the range of 10 to 24. 
     Examples of preferred secondary soaps for use herein are water-soluble members selected from the group consisting of the water-soluble salts of 2-methyl-1-tetradecanoic acid, 2-ethyl-1-tridecanoic acid, 2-propyl-1-dodecanoic acid, 2-butyl-1-undecanoic acid; 2-pentyl-1-decanoic acid, 2-hexyl-1-nonanoic acid; 2-methyl-1-pentadecanoic acid; 2-hexyl-1-decanoic acid; 2-heptyl-1-undecanoic acid; 2-ethyl hexanoic acid; and mixtures thereof. 
     In a preferred embodiment the secondary soap is selected on the basis of product odor both in neat form and dilute aqueous solutions. Secondary soaps of the form R 3  CH(R 4 )COOM in which the total carbon number is constant, odor improves as the length of the shorter alkyl chain (R 4 ) increases, e.g. 2-butyl-1-octanoic acid is preferred over 2-methyl-1-undecanoic acid. Similarly, secondary soaps in which R 4  is a fixed carbon number, the odor improves as the total carbon increases (i.e. R 3  increases). For example, 2-methyl-1-dodecanoic acid is preferred over 2-methyl-1-undecanoic acid. 
     The liquid detergent compositions according to the present invention containing such water-soluble special soaps exhibit quite low interfacial tensions, good grease removal properties. 
     Preferred selected soaps are C 15  -C 18 , The soaps can be employed in any water-soluble salt form, e.g. alkali metal, alkaline earth metals ammonium, alkanolammonium, dialkanol ammonium, trialkanol ammonium, 1-5 carbon alkyl substituted ammonium, basic amino acid groups, and the like; all of these counterions are well-known to manufacturers. The sodium salt form is convenient, cheap and effective. The acid form can also be used, but will usually be converted into the ionic form the pH adjustments which are made during processing of the compositions. 
     The selected secondary soaps employed herein to provide low interfacial tension and good greasy cleaning are those which contain a carboxyl unit connected to a secondary carbon. It is to be understood herein that the secondary carbon can be in a ting structure, e.g. as in p-decyl benzoic acid, or as in alkyl-substituted cyclohexyl carboxylates. The special soaps should contain no ether linkages, no ester linkages and no hydroxyl groups. There should be no nitrogen atoms in the head-group (amphiphilic portion). The special soaps usually contain 15-18 total carbon atoms, although slightly more (e.g. about 16-20) are preferred if the soap contains a ring structure, as noted above, e.g. p-decyl benzoic acid. 
     For purposes of illustration, and not by way of limitation, the special soaps based on the following secondary fatty acids produce low interfacial tension when used in the manner of this invention: 2-methyl-1-tetradecanoic acid, 2-ethyl-1-tridecanoic acid, 2-propyl-1-dodecanoic acid, 2-butyl-1-undecanoic acid; 2-pentyl-1-decanoic acid, 2-hexyl-1-nonanoic acid; 2-methyl-1-pentadecanoic acid; 2-hexyl-1-decanoic acid; 2-heptyl-1-undecanoic acid; p-decyl benzoic acid; and trans-4-decylcyclohexane carboxylic acid. 
     The inclusion of specially selected soap materials into the liquid detergent compositions substantially enhances their ability to rapidly lower the interfacial tension of aqueous washing liquors with greasy and oily soils. This substantial reduction of interfacial tension leads to improved removal of greasy and oily soils from surfaces and inhibits the redeposition of the soils onto substrates. 
     By &#34;interfacial tension&#34; (&#34;IFT&#34;) herein is meant the tension measured at the oil/water interface. IFT measurements using the spinning drop technique, are disclosed by Cayias, Schechter and Wade, &#34;The Measurement of Low Interfacial Tension via the Spinning Drop Technique&#34;, ACS Symposium Series No. 8 (1975) ADSORPTION AT INTERFACES, beginning at page 234. Equipment for running IFT measurements is currently available from W. H. Wade, Depts. of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, the University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Tex. 78712. 
     Highly preferred secondary soaps are C 15  -C 18  secondary soaps (the aforesaid numbers are intended to include the total carbon number including the carboxylate carbon atom in the special soaps), in that it has been found that C 15  -C 18  secondary soaps when incorporated into the liquid detergents require substantial less of an amount of a suds suppressor compared to secondary soaps having less than 15 carbon atoms. 
     Typically, the liquid laundry detergent composition of the present invention comprises from 0.1 to 50%, preferably from 1 to 15%, most preferably from 2 to 10% of a specially selected soap by weight of the total detergent composition. 
     Lipolytic Enzyme 
     A second essential ingredient in the present laundry detergent compositions is a performance-enhancing amount, preferably from about 0.0001 to 1.0% on an active basis, of a detergent-compatible lipase (lipolytic enzyme). By &#34;detergent-compatible&#34; is meant compatibility with the other ingredients of the composition, particularly detergent surfactants and any detergency builders. Liquid detergent compositions, particularly heavy duty liquids, are preferred herein. 
     Any lipase suitable for use in a laundry detergent composition can be used herein. Suitable lipases for use herein include those of bacterial and fungal origin. Lipase from chemically or genetically modified mutants are included herein. 
     Suitable bacterial lipases include those produced by Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas stutzeri ATCC19.154, as disclosed in British Patent 1,372,034, incorporated herein by reference. Suitable lipases include those which show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the antibody of the lipase produced by the microorganism Pseudomonas fluorescens IAM 1057. This lipase and a method for its purification have been described in Japanese Patent Application 53-20487, laid open on Feb. 24, 1978, which is incorporated herein by reference. This lipase is available under the trade name Lipase P &#34;Amano,&#34; hereinafter referred to as &#34;Amano-P.&#34; Such lipases should show a positive immunological cross reaction with Amano-P antibody, using the standard and well-known immunodiffusion procedure according to Ouchterlony (Acta. Med. Scan., 133, pages 76-79 (1950)). These lipases, and a method for their immunological cross-reaction with Amano-P, are also described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,291, Thom et al., issued Nov. 17, 1987, incorporated herein by reference. Typical examples thereof are the Amano-P lipase, the lipase ex Pseudomonas fragi FERM P 1339 (available under the trade name Amano-B), lipase ex Pseudomonas nitroreducens var. lipolyticum FERM P 1338 (available under the trade name Amano-CES), lipases ex Chromobacter viscosum, e.g., Chromobacter viscosum  var. lipolyticum NRRLB 3673, and further Chromobacter viscosum lipases, and lipases ex Pseudomonas gladioli. Other lipases of interest are Amano AKG and Bacillis Sp lipase. 
     Suitable fungal lipases include those producible by Humicola lanuginosa and Thermomyces lanuginosus. Most preferred is lipases obtained by cloning the gene from Humicola lanuginosa and expressing the gene in Aspergillus oryzae as described in European Patent Application 0 258 068, incorporated herein by reference, commercially available under the trade name Liplase™. 
     From about 2 to about 20,000, preferably about 10 to about 6,000, most preferably from about 200 to about 2000, lipase units per gram (LU/g) of lipase can be used in these compositions. A lipase unit is that amount of lipase which produces 1 μmol of titratable butyric acid per minute in a pH stat, where pH is 7.0, temperature is 30° C, and substrate is an emulsion of tributyrin, and gum arabic, in the presence of Ca ++  and NaCl in phosphate buffer. 
     Suprisingly, the specially selected soap materials herein do not inhibit the activity of the lipolytic enzyme. The compositions of the invention herein containing the lipase and soap material provide good cleaning of grease/oil soils particularly when used in a pre-treatment step during normal washing of fabrics containing said soils. 
     Fabric Laundering and Pretreatment Process 
     The present invention also provides a process for laundering fabrics soiled with greasy/oily stains or soil. Such a process employs contacting these fabrics with an aqueous washing solution formed from an effective amount of the detergent compositions hereinbefore described. Contacting of fabrics with washing solution will generally occur under conditions of agitation. 
     Agitation is preferably provided in a washing machine for good cleaning. Washing is preferably followed by drying the wet fabric in a conventional clothes dryer. An effective amount of the liquid or granular detergent composition in the aqueous wash solution in the washing machine is preferably from about 500 to about 7000 ppm, more preferably from about 1000 to 3000 ppm. 
     The detergent compositions herein may also be used to pretreat fabrics containing greasy/oily soils or stains prior to washing such fabrics using conventional aqueous washing solutions. Such pretreatment involves the application of highly concentrated forms of the detergent compositions herein directly onto the greasy or oily stains or soils found on the fabric to be cleaned. For compositions herein in liquid form, this will generally involve the direct application of the composition as is to the stain/soil on the fabric. 
     Pretreatment of greasy/oily stains or soils will generally occur for a period of from about 30 seconds to 24 hours prior to washing the pretreated soiled/stained substrate in conventional manner. More preferably, pretreatment times will range from about 1 to 180 minutes. 
     Suds Suppressor System 
     In addition to the specially selected secondary soap and lipolytic enzyme, the liquid detergent composition of the present invention preferably contains a suds suppressor system. 
     A wide variety of materials may be used as suds suppressors, and suds suppressors are well known to those skilled in the art. See, for example, Kirk Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology, Third Edition, Volume 7, pages 430-447 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 1979). One category of suds suppressor of particular interest encompasses monocarboxylic fatty acid and soluble salts therein (See U.S. Pat. No. 2,954,347). The monocarboxylic fatty acids and salts thereof used as suds suppressor typically have hydrocarbyl chains of 10 to about 24 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 18 carbon atoms. Suitable salts include the alkali metal salts such as sodium, potassium and lithium salts, and ammonium and alkanolammonium salts. 
     The detergent compositions herein may also contain non-surfactant suds suppressors. These include, for example, high molecular weight hydrocarbons such as paraffin, fatty acid esters (e.g. fatty acid triglycerides), fatty acid esters of monovalent alcohols, aliphatic C 18  -C 40  ketones (e.g. stearone), etc. Other suds inhibitors include N-alkylated amino triazines such as tri- to hexa-alkylmelamines or di- to tetra-alkyldiamine chlortriazines formed as products of cyanuric chloride with two or three moles of a primary or secondary amine containing 1 to 24 carbon atoms, propylene oxide, and monostearyl phosphates such as monostearyl alcohol phosphate ester and monostearyl dialkali metal (e.g. K, Na and Li) phosphates and phosphate esters. The hydrocarbons such as paraffin and haloparaffin can be utilized in liquid form. The liquid hydrocarbons will be liquid at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, and will have a pour point in the range of about -40° C. and about 50° C., and a minimum boiling point not less than about 110° C. (atmospheric pressure). It is also known to utilize waxy hydrocarbons, preferably having a melting point below about 100° C. The hydrocarbons constitute a preferred category of suds suppressor for detergent compositions. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are described, for example, in U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,779. The hydrocarbons, thus, include aliphatic, alicyclic, aromatic and heterocyclic saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbons having from about 12 to about 70 carbon atoms. The term &#34;paraffin&#34;, as used in this suds suppressor discussion, is intended to include mixtures of true paraffins and cyclic hydrocarbons. 
     Another preferred category of non-surfactant suds suppressors comprises silicone suds suppressors. This category includes the use of polyorganosiloxane oils, such as polydimethylsiloxane, dispersions or emulsions of polyorganosiloxane oils or resins, and combinations of polyorganosiloxane with silica particles wherein the polyorganosiloxane is chemisorbed or fused onto the silica. Silicone suds suppressors are well known in the art and are, for example, disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,265,779, and European Patent Application No. 89307851.9, published Feb. 7, 1990, by Starch, M. S. 
     Other silicone suds suppressors are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,455,839, which relates to compositions and processes for defoaming aqueous solutions by incorporating therein small amounts of polydimethylsiloxane fluids. 
     Mixtures of silicone and silanated silica are described, for instance, in German Patent Application DOS 2,124,526. Silicone defoamers and suds controlling agents in granular detergent compositions are disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,933,672 and in U.S. Pat. No. 4,652,392. 
     An exemplary silicone based suds suppressor for use herein is a suds suppressing amount of a suds controlling agent consisting essentially of: 
     (i) polydimethylsiloxane fluid having a viscosity of from about 20 cs. to about 1,500 cs. at 25° C.; 
     (ii) from about 5 to about 50 parts per 100 parts by weight of (I) of siloxane resin composed of (CH 3 ) 3  SiO 1/2  units of SiO 2  units in a ratio of from (CH 3 ) 3  SiO 1/2  units and to SiO 2  units of from about 0.6:1 to about 1.2:1, and 
     (iii) from about 1 to about 20 parts per 100 parts by weight of (i) of a solid silica gel. 
     In the preferred silicone suds suppressor used herein, the solvent for a continuous phase is made up of certain polyethylene glycols or polyethylene-polypropylene glycol copolymers or mixtures thereof (preferred), or polypropylene glycol. The preferred primary silicone suds suppressor is branched/crosslinked. 
     To illustrate this point further, typical liquid laundry detergent compositions with controlled suds will optionally comprise from about 0.001 to about 1, preferably from about 0.01 to about 0.7, most preferably from about 0.05 to about 0.5 weight % of said silicone suds suppressor, which comprises (1) a nonaqueous emulsion of a primary antifoam agent which is a mixture of (a) a polyorganosiloxane, (b) a resinous siloxane or a silicone resin-producing silicone compound, (c) a finely divided filler material, and (d) a catalyst to promote the reaction of mixture components (a), (b) and (c), to form silanolates; (2) at least one nonionic silicone surfactant, and (3) polyethylene glycol or a copolymer of polyethylene-polypropylene glycol having a solubility in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight % and without polypropylene glycol. Similar amounts can be used in granular compositions, gels, etc. See also U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,978,471 and 4,983,316, 5,288,431 and 4,639,489 and 4,749,740. 
     The silicone suds suppressor herein preferably comprises polyethylene glycol and a copolymer of polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol, all having an average molecular weight of less than about 1,000, preferably between about 100 and 800. The polyethylene glycol and polyethylene/polypropylene copolymers herein have a solubility in water at room temperature of more than about 2 weight %, preferably more than about 5 weight %. 
     The preferred solvent herein is polyethylene glycol having an average molecular weight of less than about 1,000, preferably between about 100 and 800, most preferably between 200 and 400, and a copolymer of polyethylene glycol/polypropylene glycol, preferably PPG 200/PEG 300. Preferred is a weight ratio of between about 1:1 and 1:10, most preferably between 1:3 and 1:6, of polyethylene glycol copolymer of polyethylenepolypropylene glycol. 
     The preferred silicone suds suppressors used herein do not contain polypropylene glycol, particularly of 4,000 molecular weight. They also preferably do not contain block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, like PURONIC L101. 
     Other suds suppressors useful herein comprise the secondary alcohols (e.g. 2-alkyl alkanols) and mixtures of such alcohols with silicone oils, such as the silicones disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,798,679, 4,075,118 and EP 150 872. The secondary alcohols include the C 6  -C 16  alkyl alcohols having a C 1  -C 16  chain. A preferred alcohol is 2-butyl octanol, which is available from Condea under the trademark ISOFOL 12. Mixtures of secondary alcohols are available under the trademark ISALCHEM 123 from Enichem. Mixed suds suppressors typically comprise mixtures of alcohol+silicone at a weight ratio of 1:5 to 5:1. 
     For any detergent compositions to be used in automatic laundry washing machines, suds should not form to the extent that they overflow the washing machine. Suds suppressors, when utilized, are preferably present in a &#34;suds suppressing amount&#34;. By &#34;suds suppressing amount&#34; is meant that the formulator of the composition can select an amount of this suds controlling agent that will sufficiently control the suds to result in a low-sudsing laundry detergent for use in automatic laundry washing machines. 
     When utilized mainly as suds suppressors, monocarboxylic fatty acids, and salts therein, will be present typically in amounts up to about 15% by weight of the detergent composition. Preferably from about 5% to about 15% of fatty monocarboxylate suds suppressor is utilized. In addition, the compositions herein will generally comprise from 0% to about 5% of suds suppressor. Silicone suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts up to about 2.0% by weight of the detergent composition, although higher amounts may be used. This upper limit is practical in nature, due primarily to concern with keeping costs minimized and effectiveness of lower amounts for effectively controlling sudsing. Preferably from about 0.01% to about 1% of silicone suds suppressor is used, more preferably from about 0.25% to about 0.5%. As used herein, these weight percentage values include any silica that may be utilized in combination with polyorganosiloxane, as well as any adjunct materials that may be utilized. Monostearyl phosphate suds suppressors are generally utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.1% to about 2%, by weight, of the composition. Hydrocarbon suds suppressors are typically utilized in amounts ranging from about 0.01% to about 5.0%, although higher levels can be used. The alcohol suds suppressors are typically used at 0.2%-3% by weight of the finished compositions.

     In another embodiment of the present invention, the liquid detergent composition may comprise one or more of a surfactant selected from a wide range of surfactants. 
     A typical listing of anionic, nonionic, ampholytic and zwitterionic classes, and species of these surfactants, is given in U.S. Pat. No. 3,664,961 issued to Norris on May 23, 1972.

     The present invention is to laundry detergent compositions comprising shading dyes. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Anti-soil redeposition aids and shading dyes have been used in liquid laundry detergent compositions previously. These two technologies enable improved whiteness and brightness of fabrics that have been washed using compositions containing them. 
     Shading dyes visually whiten textile substrates and counteract the fading and yellowing of the textiles substrates. Anti-soil redeposition aids prevent the redeposition of soils suspended in the wash liquor back onto fabrics during the wash process. These suspended soils have previously been removed from the textiles during the wash operation and are present in the wash liquor ahead of the wash liquor being discarded. The anti soil redeposition aids prevent the soil from depositing back onto the fabrics and giving the fabrics a ‘dull’ or ‘grey’ appearance. 
     However, a problem encountered with shading dyes is that of ‘fabric spot staining’. This is the process by which high concentrations of the shading dye are deposited onto small localized areas of the fabric and cause discolouration. 
     There is a need in the art for a liquid laundry detergent composition that comprises excellent fabric brightness and whiteness benefits, but which exhibits reduced fabric spot staining tendency. 
     The Inventors surprisingly found that a liquid laundry detergent composition comprising the specific combination of a shading dye according to the present invention and an alkoxylated polymer solved the above mentioned need. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention is to a liquid laundry detergent composition comprising;
         a. an alkoxylated polymer comprising at least two alkoxylated groups selected from the groups consisting of amines, imines, amides, imides, and mixtures thereof;   b. a shading dye comprising a dye polymer comprising a chromophore covalently bound to one or more of at least three consecutive repeat units.       

    
    
     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     Composition 
     The liquid laundry detergent composition of the present invention comprises;
         a. an alkoxylated polymer comprising at least two alkoxylated groups selected from the groups consisting of amines, imines, amides, imides, and mixtures thereof;   b. a shading dye comprising a dye polymer comprising a chromophore covalently bound to one or more of at least three consecutive repeat units.       

     The composition of the present invention is a liquid laundry detergent composition. The term ‘liquid laundry detergent composition’ refers to any laundry detergent composition comprising a fluid capable of wetting and treating fabric e.g., cleaning clothing in a domestic washing machine, and includes, but is not limited to, liquids, gels, pastes, dispersions and the like. The liquid composition can include solids or gases in suitably subdivided form, but the fluid composition excludes forms which are non-fluid overall, such as tablets or granules. 
     The liquid composition may be in the form of a unit dose article. The unit dose article of the present invention comprises a water-soluble film which fully encloses the liquid composition in at least one compartment. 
     The liquid laundry detergent composition can be used as a fully formulated consumer product, or may be added to one or more further ingredient to form a fully formulated consumer product. The liquid laundry detergent composition may be a ‘pre-treat’ composition which is added to a fabric, preferably a fabric stain, ahead of the fabric being added to a wash liquor. 
     The liquid laundry detergent composition can be used in a fabric hand wash operation or may be used in an automatic machine fabric wash operation. 
     The liquid laundry detergent composition comprises an alkoxylated polymer. Suitable alkoxylated polymers are described in more detail below. 
     The liquid laundry detergent composition comprises a shading dye. Suitable shading dyes are described in more detail below. 
     Without wishing to be bound by theory, the Inventors believe that the shading dye interacts with the alkoxylated polymer such that the shading dye is ‘locked away’ when it is released in the wash liquor. This means that it is released to the fabrics more slowly as it dissociates from the alkoxylated polymer and so this reduces the likelihood of large concentrations of the shading dye interacting with localized areas of the fabric. This in turn reduces the instances of fabric spot staining. 
     Alkoxylated Polymer 
     The composition of the present invention comprises an alkoxylated polymer comprising at least two alkoxylated groups selected from the groups consisting of amines, imines, amides, imides, and mixtures thereof.

The fluid compositions preferably have densities in the range from of 0.9 to 1.3 grams per cubic centimeter, more preferably from 1.00 to 1.1 grams per cubic centimeter, excluding any solid additives, but including any bubbles, if present. The unit dose article can be of any form, shape and material which is suitable for holding the fluid composition, i.e. without allowing the release of the fluid composition, and any additional component, from the unit dose article prior to contact of the unit dose article with water. The exact execution will depend, for example, on the type and amount of the compositions in the unit dose article, the number of compartments in the unit dose article, and on the characteristics required from the unit dose article to hold, protect and deliver or release the compositions or components. 
     The unit dose article comprises a water-soluble film which fully encloses the fluid composition in at least one compartment. The unit dose article may optionally comprise additional compartments; said additional compartments may comprise an additional composition. Said additional composition may be fluid, solid, and mixtures thereof. Alternatively, any additional solid component may be suspended in a fluid-filled compartment.

This is stirred vigorously on a magnetic stirrer set at 600 rpm, for 30 minutes. Then, the mixture is filtered through a folded qualitative sintered-glass filter with a pore size as defined above (max. 20 micron). The water is dried off from the collected filtrate by any conventional method, and the weight of the remaining material is determined (which is the dissolved or dispersed fraction). Then, the percentage solubility or dispersability can be calculated.

     Preferred water soluble films are those resins comprising one or more PVA polymers, preferably said water soluble film resin comprises a blend of PVA polymers. For example, the PVA resin can include at least two PVA polymers, wherein as used herein the first PVA polymer has a viscosity less than the second PVA polymer. A first PVA polymer can have a viscosity of at least 8 cP (cP mean centipoise), 10 cP, 12 cP, or 13 cP and at most 40 cP, 20 cP, 15 cP, or 13 cP, for example in a range of about 8 cP to about 40 cP, or 10 cP to about 20 cP, or about 10 cP to about 15 cP, or about 12 cP to about 14 cP, or 13 cP. Furthermore, a second PVA polymer can have a viscosity of at least about 10 cP, 20 cP, or 22 cP and at most about 40 cP, 30 cP, 25 cP, or 24 cP, for example in a range of about 10 cP to about 40 cP, or 20 to about 30 cP, or about 20 to about 25 cP, or about 22 to about 24, or about 23 cP. The viscosity of a PVA polymer is determined by measuring a freshly made solution using a Brookfield LV type viscometer with UL adapter as described in British Standard EN ISO 15023-2:2006 Annex E Brookfield Test method. It is international practice to state the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solutions at 20 .deg.C. All viscosities specified herein in cP should be understood to refer to the viscosity of 4% aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution at 20 .deg.C, unless specified otherwise. Similarly, when a resin is described as having (or not having) a particular viscosity, unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the specified viscosity is the average viscosity for the resin, which inherently has a corresponding molecular weight distribution.

Similarly, when the PVA resin includes a first PVA polymer having an average viscosity less than about 11 cP and a polydispersity index in a range of about 1.8 to about 2.3, then in another, non-exclusive type of embodiment the PVA resin contains less than about 30 wt. % of a PVA polymer havin2 a Mw less than about 70,000 Daltons. 
     Of the total PVA resin content in the film described herein, the PVA resin can comprise about 30 to about 85 wt. % of the first PVA polymer, or about 45 to about 55 wt. % of the first PVA polymer. For example, the PVA resin can contain about 50 wt. % of each PVA polymer, wherein the viscosity of the first PVA polymer is about 13 cP and the viscosity of the second PVA polymer is about 23 cP. 
     One type of embodiment is characterized by the PVA resin including about 40 to about 85 wt. % of a first PVA polymer that has a viscosity in a range of about 10 to about 15 cP and a degree of hydrolysis in a range of about 84% to about 92%. Another type of embodiment is characterized by the PVA resin including about 45 to about 55 wt. % of the first PVA polymer that has a viscosity in a range of about 10 to about 15 cP and a degree of hydrolysis in a range of about 84% to about 92%.

One contemplated class of embodiments is characterized by the PVA resin including about 45 to about 55 wt. % of the second PVA polymer. 
     When the PVA resin includes a plurality of PVA polymers the PDI value of the PVA resin is greater than the PDI value of any individual, included PVA polymer. Optionally, the PIN value of the PVA resin is greater than 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8, 2.9, 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3,3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3,7, 3.8, 3.9, 4.0, 4.5, or 5.0. 
     Preferably the PVA resin that has a weighted, average degree of hydrolysis (H. deg.) between about 80 and about 92%, or between about 83 and about 90%, or about 85 and 89%.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION 
   The present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the drawings showing preferred embodiments thereof. It should, however, be understood that the illustrated embodiments are merely examples for the purpose of understanding the invention, and should not be taken as limiting the scope of the invention. 
   General Configuration of Electronic Musical Apparatus 
     FIG. 1  shows a block diagram illustrating the overall hardware configuration of an electronic musical apparatus incorporating an embodiment of an apparatus for automatically starting an add-on progression according to the present invention. The electronic musical apparatus may be an electronic musical instrument or may be a musical data processing apparatus such as a personal computer (PC) coupled with a music playing unit and a tone generating unit to provide a musical data processing function to be equivalent to an electronic musical instrument. The electronic musical apparatus comprises a central processing unit (CPU)  1 , a random access memory (RAM)  2 , a read-only memory (ROM)  3 , an external storage device ( 4 ), a play detection circuit  5 , a controls detection circuit  6 , a display circuit  7 , a tone generator circuit  8 , an effect circuit  9 , a sound data input interface  10 , a communication interface  11  and a MIDI interface  12 , all of which are connected with each other via a system bus  13 . 
   The CPU  1 , the RAM  2  and the ROM  3  together constitutes a data processing circuit DP, which conducts various music data processing including music piece recognizing processing according to a given control program utilizing a clock signal from a timer  14 . The RAM  2  is used as work areas for temporarily storing various data necessary for the processing. The ROM  3  stores beforehand various control programs, control data, music performance data and so forth necessary for executing the processing according to the present invention. 
   The external storage device  4  may include a built-in storage medium such as a hard disk (HD) as well as various portable external storage media such as a compact disk read-only memory (CD-ROM), a flexible disk (FD), a magneto-optical (MO) disk, a digital versatile disk (DVD), a semiconductor (SC) memory such as a small-sized memory card like Smart Media™ and so forth. Thus various kinds of data including control programs can be stored in various suitable external storage devices  4 . Further, any predetermined external storage device (e.g. a HD)  4  can be used for providing a music piece database, an accompaniment database, a description data base, a picture database. 
   The play detection circuit  5  detects the user&#39;s operations of a music-playing device  14  such as a keyboard, and sends the musical performance data in the MIDI format (herein after “MIDI data”) representing the user&#39;s operations to the data processing circuit DP. The control detection circuit  6  detects the user&#39;s operations of the setting controls  16  such as key switches and a mouse device, and sends the settings data representing the set conditions of the setting controls  16  to the data processing circuit DP. The setting controls  16  include, for example, switches for setting conditions of tone signal generation by the tone generator circuit  8  and the effect circuit  9 , mode switches for setting modes such as a music piece recognition mode, add-on selection switches for selectively designating the add-on matters such as an accompaniment, a description display and a picture display under the music piece recognition mode, a fade-in switch for commanding “to fade in immediately” with respect to the start of the output such as an accompaniment, and a display selection switch for selectively designating items to be displayed such as a music score, words for the music, chord names, and so forth when the designated output is a description display. The display circuit  7  is connected to a display device  17  such as an LCD panel displaying screen images and pictures and various indicators (not shown) to control the displayed contents and lighting conditions of these devices according to the instructions from the CPU  1 , and also presents GUIs for assisting the user in operating the music-playing device  15  and the setting controls  16 . 
   The tone generator circuit  8  and the effect circuit  9  function as a tone signal generating unit (also referred to as a “tone generator unit”), wherein the tone generator circuit  8  generates tone data according to the real-time performance MIDI data derived from the play detection circuit  5  and the effect circuit  9  including an effect imparting DSP (digital signal processor) imparts intended tone effects to the tone data, thereby producing tone signals for the real-time performance. The tone signal generating unit  8 + 9  also serves to generate tone signals for an accompaniment in accordance with the accompaniment data determined in response to the real-time performance MIDI data during the music piece recognizing processing, and to generate tone signals for an automatic musical performance in accordance with the performance data read out from the storage devices  3  and  4  during the automatic performance processing. To the effect circuit  9  is connected a sound system  18 , which includes a D/A converter, an amplifier and a loudspeaker, and emits audible sounds based on the effect imparted musical tone signals from the effect circuit  9 . 
   To the sound data input interface  10  is connected a sound input apparatus  30  which includes a microphone, a sound signal generating device such as an electric guitar, and a sound signal processing circuit. The sound input apparatus  30  digitizes the input signals from the microphone or the sound signal generating device by means of the sound signal processing circuit, thereby converting to sound data, which in turn is sent to the data processing circuit DP via the sound data input interface  10 . The sound data sent to the data processing circuit DP may be converted back to sound wave signals through the effect circuit  9  in order to emit audible sounds from the sound system  18  so that input sound signals from the microphone or the sound signal generating device are amplified to sound loud. 
   The communication interface  11  is to connect the electronic musical apparatus to a communication network  40  such as the Internet and a local area network (LAN) so that control programs and performance data files can be downloaded from an external server computer  50  or the like and stored in the storage device  4  for use in this electronic musical apparatus. 
   To the MIDI interface  10  is connected an external MIDI apparatus  60  having a MIDI musical data processing function like this electronic musical apparatus so that MIDI musical data can be exchanged between this electronic musical apparatus and the separate or remote MIDI apparatus  60  via the MIDI interface  11 . The MIDI data from the external MIDI apparatus  60  representing the manipulations of the music playing device in the external MIDI apparatus can be used in this electronic musical apparatus to generate tone signals of the real-time musical performance by means of the tone signal generating unit  8 + 9  as in the case of the real-time performance MIDI data generated by the manipulations of the music playing device  15  of this electronic musical apparatus. 
   Embodiments of Electronic Musical Apparatus 
   An apparatus for automatically starting an add-on progression to run along with a played music piece according to the present invention conducts a music piece recognition processing when a mode switch manipulated in the setting controls designates the music piece recognition mode, and automatically recognizes or identifies the music piece of which the melody or the song has been started to be played by the user or player, and then automatically starts an add-on progression which matches the music piece to run successively along with the progression of the music piece played by the user. The first embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus for automatically starting an accompaniment to a music piece to run along with the progression of the music piece played by the user, the second embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus for automatically starting a description display such as a display of a music score, words of a song and chord names of the music piece to run along with the progression of the music piece played by the user, and the third embodiment of the present invention is an apparatus for automatically starting a picture display including picture images which match the music piece to run along with the progression of the music piece played by the user. These embodiments will be described in detail herein below with reference to  FIGS. 2-4 . 
   First Embodiment 
   An apparatus for starting an accompaniment to a music piece according to the first embodiment is to function when the add-on selection switch among the setting controls  16  designates the accompaniment function. The apparatus recognizes the music piece which the user has started to play or sing, and selects an adequate accompaniment data file and causes the selected accompaniment to start automatically and run along with the progression of the music piece.  FIG. 2  shows a block diagram illustrating the functional configuration of the apparatus for automatically starting an accompaniment progression under the first embodiment. The apparatus is comprised of a voice/sound input unit A, a MIDI signal forming unit B, a MIDI signal input unit C, a music piece database D, a music piece recognizing unit E, an accompaniment database F and an accompaniment controlling unit G. The functional units A-C constitute a performance data input device for inputting the musical performance data in the MIDI format (MIDI data) which can be processed in the music piece recognizing unit E. 
   The voice/sound input unit A corresponds in function to the sound input apparatus  30  plus the sound data input interface  10 . As the user, for example, sings a song or hums a tune or play a melody with a musical instrument such as a guitar, the sounds of the user&#39;s performance are inputted through a microphone in the sound input apparatus, the tone signals representing the sound waves of the voices by singing or humming or tones by instrumental playing are digitized by the sound signal processing circuit in the sound input apparatus  30 , and the digitized sound data are inputted via the sound data input interface  10  into the data processing circuit DP. The MIDI signal forming circuit B corresponds in function to a MIDI signal forming portion in the data processing circuit DP, and forms a MIDI format signal by analyzing the sound data inputted from the voice/sound input unit A to detect the event times, the pitches, the durations, etc. of the notes, thereby converting the sound data into MIDI data. 
   The MIDI signal input unit C corresponds in function to the music playing device  15  plus the play detection circuit  5  or to the external MIDI apparatus  60  plus the MIDI interface  12 , and inputs the MIDI data generated by the user&#39;s operations of the music playing device  15  or the MIDI data received from the external MIDI apparatus  60  into the data processing circuit DP. 
   The music piece database D corresponds in function to such a portion of the external storage  4  that constitutes the music piece database, and stores music piece data files of a number of music pieces. Each of the music piece data files contains, for example, music piece title data representing the title of the music piece, music piece ID data representing the music piece ID for identifying the music piece, reference tempo data representing the reference tempo value at which the music piece is to be performed, pitch and duration string data (may be simply referred to as “note string data”) consisting of an array of pitch and duration pairs (expressed in the pitch-duration coordinate system) representing the pitch and the duration of each of the notes which constitute the music piece and placed along the time axis, and some other necessary data. 
   The music piece recognizing unit E corresponds in function to a music piece recognizing portion of the data processing circuit DP, and is supplied with the MIDI data converted from the sound data by the MIDI signal forming unit B and the MIDI data inputted via the MIDI signal input unit C. While the illustrated embodiment has two MIDI data input channels, the channel of the voice/sound input unit A plus the MIDI signal forming unit B and the channel of the MIDI signal input unit C, both of the two channels may not necessarily be provided, but either of the two channels may suffice. 
   The music piece recognizing unit E first converts the supplied MIDI data into string data of the same pitch-and-duration pair format as the pitch-and-duration pair strings of the music piece data files stored in the music piece database D. Then a predetermined length of the head portion (e.g. first several measures) of the supplied MIDI data of pitch-and-duration pair strings are subject to pattern matching processing with the music piece data files in the music piece database D to determine which music piece the supplied MIDI data represents, thereby recognizing or identifying the inputted music piece. More specifically, the music piece data file whose head portion has the closest match in the pitch-and-duration pair array pattern with the head portion of the inputted music data is extracted as the music piece being played by the user. 
   The music piece recognizing unit E conducts the pattern matching processing of the pitch-and-duration array pattern without taking the tempo and the key of the music progression into consideration, but further compares the pitch arrays and the duration arrays individually between the inputted MIDI data and the extracted music piece data file to determine (detect) the tempo of the inputted MIDI data and the transposition interval. For example, the time length of the pitch-and-duration array of the inputted MIDI data and that of the extracted music piece data file having a matched length of array with each other are compared to obtain the ratio or the difference between the two, and then the tempo of the inputted MIDI data is determined based on the obtained tempo ratio or tempo difference and the reference tempo of the music piece data file. Similarly, the pitch difference (average difference) between the corresponding notes contained in the pitch-and-duration arrays of the inputted MIDI data and of the extracted music piece data file are detected, and then the transposition interval of the inputted MIDI data from the extracted music piece data file is determined based on the detected pitch difference. The music piece recognizing unit E further determines (detects) the time positions of the beats and the bar lines along the progression of the music piece based on the tempo and the time lapsed with respect to the inputted MIDI data. 
   Finally, the music piece recognizing unit E outputs to the accompaniment controlling unit G a control data signal instructing the start of the accompaniment based on the music piece ID data of the music piece extracted from the music piece database D, and on the tempo, the transposition interval and the time positions along the progression of the MIDI data obtained from the extracted music piece data, and further on the manipulation condition of the fade-in switch among the setting controls  16 . Similarly, control data signals will be supplied to the description controlling unit J of the second embodiment shown in  FIG. 5  and the picture controlling unit L of the third embodiment shown in  FIG. 6 . 
     FIGS. 5   a  and  5   b  show examples of inputting the MIDI data, wherein hollow blocks Pa through Pe denote an array of “pitch-and-duration” data pairs at the head portion of the inputted MIDI data string, and hatched blocks Sa through Se denote an array of “pitch-and-duration” data pairs at the head portion of the music piece data file extracted from the music piece database D correspondent to the inputted MIDI data. As shown in the Figures, the array pattern of the “pitch-and-duration” pairs Pa-Pe in the inputted MIDI data matches with the array pattern of the “pitch-and-duration” pairs Sa-Se in the reference music piece data. 
     FIG. 5   a  shows a timing chart illustrating the time position pattern of the “pitch-and-duration” data pairs when the MIDI data are inputted in a faster tempo than the reference music piece data. The total time length from t 0  to tp of the data array Pa-Pe which is the time length of the duration string constituted by the duration data in the “pitch-and-duration” data pairs at the head portion of the inputted MIDI data is shorter than the total time length from t 0  to ts of the data array Sa-Se which is the time length of the duration string constituted by the duration data in the “pitch-and-duration” data pairs at the head portion of the reference music piece data file. Thus, when the tempos of the two musical progression data are different from each other, the tempo of the inputted MIDI data can be obtained by (the tempo value of the reference music piece)×(the time length tp of the inputted duration string)/(the time length ts of the reference duration string). 
     FIG. 5   b  shows a timing chart illustrating the time and pitch position pattern of the “pitch-and-duration” data pairs when the MIDI data are inputted in a transposed key with respect to the reference music piece data, wherein the pitches of the “pitch-and-duration” data pairs Pa-Pe at the head portion of the MIDI data are indicated by the vertical positions on the chart and the pitches of the “pitch-and-duration” data pairs Sa-Se at the head portion of the reference music piece data are also indicated by the vertical positions on the chart. In the example shown in  FIG. 5   b , the pitches of the notes (i.e. pitch-and-duration pairs) Pa-Pe of the inputted MIDI data are lower than the pitches of the notes Sa-Se of the reference music piece extracted from the music piece database D. Thus, when the pitches of the corresponding notes in the two musical progression data are different from each other, a transposition interval which represents the pitch difference between the inputted pitch string and the reference pitch string (an average pitch difference in the case where the variation patterns of the two pitch strings are not identical) is obtained as illustrated in  FIG. 5   b.    
   The accompaniment database F corresponds in function to such a portion of the external storage  4  that constitutes the accompaniment database, and stores a number of accompaniment data files with relation to the music piece data files in the music piece database D. The accompaniment data files may be provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the music piece data files, or one accompaniment data file may be commonly used for a plurality of music piece data files. The accompaniment data file provided in a one-to-one correspondence with the music piece data file is an accompaniment data file which is composed for a particular music piece, and can be a length of complete MIDI data file for the accompaniment part of the music piece. The accompaniment data file to be used in common for a plurality of music piece data files will be an accompaniment data file of a generalized style. In the case of a generalized style accompaniment data file, a chord progression data file and a accompaniment section switchover data file (indicating the time points for changing over the accompaniment sections such as an introduction section, a main body section, a fill-in section and an ending section) may be provided separately so that an adequate accompaniment can be given to each music piece. 
   The accompaniment controlling unit G corresponds in function to such a portion of the data processing circuit DP that performs the function of controlling the accompaniment progression, and automatically selects an accompaniment data file provided for the recognized music piece according to the control data from the music piece recognizing unit E and automatically starts the playback of the accompaniment according to the selected accompaniment data file. More specifically, as the music piece recognizing unit E recognizes the inputted MIDI data to be same as a music piece in the music piece database and gives the music piece ID data of thus identified music piece, the accompaniment controlling unit G selectively reads out the accompaniment data file for the identified music piece from the accompaniment database F, sends to the musical tone generating circuit  8  plus  9  to produce musical tones for the accompaniment, and causes the accompaniment sounds to be emitted from the sound system  14  matching the progression of the MIDI data inputted by the user. Thus, the accompaniment will be started quite naturally at a suitable break-in point designated along the progression of the musical performance according to the accompaniment start instruction contained in the control data from the music piece recognizing unit E with the tempo, the transposition interval and the running position in the progression of the accompaniment being controlled in accordance with the tempo data, the transposition interval data and the progression position data (section switchover positions) in the control data. 
     FIGS. 6   a  and  6   b  illustrate how the accompaniment or another add-on progression will be started by the accompaniment controlling unit G or another add-on progression controlling unit J or L.  FIG. 6   a  illustrates an example of the operation of the case where the accompaniment or another add-on progression will be started at a break-in point according to the accompaniment start instruction after the music piece is recognized by the music piece recognizing unit E when the fade-in switch among the setting controls  16  is not turned on.  FIG. 6   b  illustrates an example of the operation of the case where the accompaniment or another add-on progression will be faded in immediately after the music piece is recognized by the music piece recognizing unit E when the fade-in switch is turned on. In each of the Figures, the top row shows a progression of the inputted MIDI data partitioned at the bar line time points, the middle row shows a recognition period which is a time length necessary for the music piece recognizing unit E to recognize (i.e. identify) the music piece of the inputted MIDI data, and the bottom row shows the progression of the accompaniment similarly partitioned by the bar lines. 
   When the fade-in switch is not turned on, the accompaniment controlling unit G starts, as shown in  FIG. 6   a , the accompaniment at a predetermined break-in time point, and more specifically, at the bar line time point t 2  which comes first after the recognition period has past at the time point t 1  when the input of the MIDI data is started at the time point t 0 . On the other hand, when the fade-in switch is turned on, the accompaniment progression is started, as shown in  FIG. 6   b , at the time point t 1  immediately after the recognition period has past when the input of the MIDI data is started at the time point t 0 , in which the volume of the accompaniment starts with a minimum level and gradually increases up to a full level toward the next coming bar line time position t 2 , namely in a fade-in fashion. 
   As described above, an apparatus for automatically starting an accompaniment to a music piece of the first embodiment stores music piece data files for a number of music pieces in the music piece database D and accompaniment data files of a generalized style or else for the respective music pieces in the accompaniment database F. As the user starts performing a music piece by playing an instrument or by singing, the performed music is inputted in MIDI data (A-C), a music piece data file which has a note string pattern coincident with the note pattern of the inputted MIDI data is extracted from the music piece database D whereby the music piece the user has started performing is recognized or identified, and further the tempo, the transposition interval, the progression points (e.g. bar lines), etc. of the inputted MIDI data are detected (E). And then, an accompaniment data file which meets the recognized music piece is automatically selected from the accompaniment database F, and an automatic accompaniment takes place in the detected tempo and transposition interval with the progression points synchronized with the MIDI data progression (G). The automatic accompaniment can be started at an adequate break-in point such as the bar line position or can be faded in immediately to realize a musically acceptable start of the accompaniment. 
   Second Embodiment 
   An apparatus for starting a description display to a music piece according to the second embodiment is to function when the add-on selection switch among the setting controls  16  designates the description display function. The apparatus recognizes the music piece which the user has started to play or sing, and selects an adequate description data file containing data for displaying descriptions such as a music score, words and chords for the recognized music piece and automatically starts displaying the selected descriptions to run along with the progression of the music piece.  FIG. 3  shows a block diagram illustrating the functional configuration of the apparatus for automatically starting a description display progression under the second embodiment. The apparatus is comprised of a voice/sound input unit A, a MIDI signal forming unit B, a MIDI signal input unit C, a music piece database D, a music piece recognizing unit E, a description database H and a description display controlling unit J. The performance data inputting units A-C, the music piece recognizing arrangement D-E are the same as in the first embodiment, but the add-on progression presenting arrangement here comprises description database H containing music scores, words, chords, etc. for a number of music pieces and a description display control unit J for controlling the display of the progression of those descriptions to run along with the progression of the music piece. 
   The description database H corresponds in function to such a portion of the external storage  4  that constitutes the description database, and stores a number of description data files with relation to the music piece data files in the music piece database. The description data file contains data representing a music score, words, chords, etc. to be displayed along with the progression of the related music piece. The description database H can store the description data in any of the form of a “music score+words+chords” set, or a “music score+words” set, or a “words+chords” set, or a “music score+chords,” or a “music score” alone, or “words” alone, or “chords” alone. 
   The music score data stored in the description database H may be music score image data in a bit-map style, or may be logical music score data representing musical notation symbols, their display locations and their display times, or may be MIDI performance data based on which music score image data can be generated. The words data may be image data for depicting the word constituting characters, or may be text data including character codes, word timing and page turning marks. The chord data may preferably be data in the text format. 
   The description display controlling unit J corresponds in function to such a portion of the data processing circuit DP that performs the function of controlling the description display progression, and automatically selects a description data file (according to the setting by the display selection switch, at least one of music score data, words data, or chords data can be designated) provided for the recognized music piece according to the control data from the music piece recognizing unit E and automatically starts the display of the musical descriptions according to the selected description data file. More specifically, as the music piece recognizing unit E recognizes the inputted MIDI data to be same as a music piece in the music piece database and gives the music piece ID data of thus identified music piece, the description display controlling unit J selectively reads out the description data file for the identified music piece from the description database H, sends to the display circuit  7  to display on the display device  17  the descriptions for the music piece which corresponds to the MIDI data inputted by the user. When displaying the musical descriptions, the display processing will be controlled in accordance with the tempo, the transposition interval and the progressing position as detected by the music piece recognizing unit E so that adequate descriptions will be successively displayed along with the progression of the inputted MIDI data. For example, the wipe speed for the respective descriptions will be varied according to the tempo, the music score and the chord names will be altered according to the transposition interval, and the displayed pages will be turned according to the progression positions of the music piece. 
   The fashion in which the display of the descriptions starts may be similar to the fashions in which the accompaniment starts in the above first embodiment. The display of the descriptions may be started at a break-in point after the recognition of the music piece has been completed as shown in  FIG. 6   a , or may be started immediately after the music piece recognition has been completed. When starting the display immediately after the music piece recognition, the display may be faded in immediately as shown in  FIG. 6   b  or may be simply started suddenly. The description display of the second embodiment may be added on solely to the music piece progression, or may be added on together with the accompaniment of the first embodiment by so setting the add-on selection switch in the setting controls  16 . 
   As described above, an apparatus for automatically starting a description display to a music piece of the second embodiment stores music piece data files for a number of music pieces in the music piece database D and description data files for displaying musical descriptions such as a music score, words and chords for each music piece to supplement the progression of the music piece in the description database H. As the user starts performing a music piece by playing an instrument or by singing, the performed music is inputted in MIDI data (A-C), a music piece data file which has a note string pattern coincident with the note pattern of the inputted MIDI data is extracted from the music piece database D whereby the music piece the user has started performing is recognized or identified, and further the tempo, the transposition interval, the progression points (e.g. bar lines), etc. of the inputted MIDI data are detected (E). And then, a musical description display data file which meets the recognized music piece is automatically selected from the description database H, and an automatic display of the musical descriptions takes place in the detected tempo and transposition interval with the progression points synchronized with the MIDI data progression (J). 
   Third Embodiment 
   An apparatus for starting a picture display to a music piece according to the third embodiment is to function when the add-on selection switch among the setting controls  16  designates the picture display function. The apparatus recognizes the music piece which the user has started to play or sing, and selects an adequate picture data file containing data for displaying pictures (motion or still) for the recognized music piece and automatically starts displaying the selected pictures to run along with the progression of the music piece.  FIG. 4  shows a block diagram illustrating the functional configuration of the apparatus for automatically starting a picture display progression under the third embodiment. The apparatus is comprised of a voice/sound input unit A, a MIDI signal forming unit B, a MIDI signal input unit C, a music piece database D, a music piece recognizing unit E, a picture database K and a picture display controlling unit L. The performance data inputting units A-C, the music piece recognizing arrangement D-E are the same as in the first and second embodiments, but the add-on progression presenting arrangement here comprises the picture database K for a number of music pieces and a picture display control unit L for controlling the display of the progression of the pictures to run along with the progression of the music piece. 
   The picture database K corresponds in function to such a portion of the external storage  4  that constitutes the picture database, and stores a number of picture data files with relation to the music piece data files in the music piece database D. The picture data file may contain data representing motion pictures such as of the images of the artist of each music piece, background images for karaoke music, animation images to meet the progression of each music piece, or may be a set of still pictures to be displayed successively such as of the images of the artist of each music piece, background images or story pictures to meet the progression of each music piece. The picture database K may contain picture data files for the music pieces in one-to-one correspondence, or one picture data file in common for a number of music pieces. 
   The picture display controlling unit L corresponds in function to such a portion of the data processing circuit DP that performs the function of controlling the picture display progression, and automatically selects a picture data file provided for the recognized music piece according to the control data from the music piece recognizing unit E and automatically starts the display of the pictures according to the selected picture data file. More specifically, as the music piece recognizing unit E recognizes the inputted MIDI data to be same as a music piece in the music piece database and gives the music piece ID data of thus identified music piece, the picture display controlling unit L selectively reads out the picture data file for the identified music piece from the picture database K, sends to the display circuit  7  to display on the display device  17  the pictures for the music piece which corresponds to the MIDI data inputted by the user. When displaying the pictures, the display processing will be controlled in accordance with the tempo and the progressing position as detected by the music piece recognizing unit E so that adequate pictures will be successively displayed along with the progression of the inputted MIDI data. For example, the playback speed of the motion picture will be varied according to the tempo, and the displayed pages of the still pictures will be turned an accordance with the progressing positions of the music piece. 
   The transposition interval detected by the music piece recognizing unit E is not used in controlling the picture display. Further, the fashion in which the display of the pictures starts may be similar to the fashions in which the accompaniment starts in the above first embodiment. Namely, the display of the pictures may be started at a break-in point after the recognition of the music piece has been completed as shown in  FIG. 6   a , or may be started immediately after the music piece recognition has been completed. When starting the display immediately after the music piece recognition, the display may be faded in immediately as shown in  FIG. 6   b  or may be simply started suddenly. 
   The picture display of the third embodiment may be added on solely to the music piece progression, or may be added on together with the accompaniment of the first embodiment and/or the description display of the second embodiment by so setting the add-on selection switch in the setting controls  16 . Further, where the story pictures are to be displayed, the story telling voice data may preferably be stored so that the story telling voices will be played back along with the progression of the display of the story pictures. 
   As described above, an apparatus for automatically starting a picture display to a music piece of the third embodiment stores music piece data files for a number of music pieces in the music piece database D and picture data files each of a motion picture or a set of still pictures for displaying pictures for each music piece to supplement the progression of the music piece in the picture database K. As the user starts performing a music piece by playing an instrument or by singing, the performed music is inputted in MIDI data (A-C), a music piece data file which has a note string pattern coincident with the note pattern of the inputted MIDI data is extracted from the music piece database D whereby the music piece the user has started performing is recognized or identified, and further the tempo, the progression points (e.g. bar lines), etc. of the inputted MIDI data are detected (E). And then, a picture display data file which meets the recognized music piece is automatically selected from the picture database K, and an automatic display of the pictures takes place in the detected tempo with the progression points synchronized with the MIDI data progression (L). 
   Processing Flow 
     FIGS. 7   a  and  7   b  show, in combination, a flowchart illustrating the processing for music piece recognition in an embodiment according to the present invention. This processing flow starts when the user manipulates the mode switch among the setting controls  16  to set the music piece recognition mode on the electronic musical apparatus and the add-on selection switch to designate the add-on matters, the accompaniment and/or the description display and/or picture display, and is executed by the music piece recognizing unit E. 
   As the processing for music piece recognition starts, the first step R 1  converts the inputted MIDI data from the performance data input units A-C to form a string data of “pitch and duration” pairs, subjects a length of the head part of thus formed “pitch and duration” pair string to a pattern matching processing (i.e. comparison) with the head portions of the music piece data files in the music piece database D tolerating the differences in the tempo and the key, and extracts the music piece data file which has the head part string pattern most coincident with the head part string pattern of the formed “pitch and duration” pairs from the music piece database D, thus recognizing or identifying the music piece by its music piece ID data. 
   Next, a step R 2  determines the tempo of the inputted MIDI data according to the ratio tp/ts of the time lengths of at the corresponding head parts of the inputted MIDI data and of the extracted music piece data file as shown in  FIG. 5   a . Subsequent to the step R 2 , a step R 3  determines the transposition interval of the inputted MIDI data from the extracted reference music piece data file according to the difference between the corresponding pitches in the two strings as shown in  FIG. 5   b.    
   Then, a step R 4  supplies the music piece ID data of the extracted music piece data file and the data representing the tempo determined by the step R 2  and the transposition interval determined by the step R 3  to the accompaniment controlling unit G and/or the description display controlling unit J and/or the picture display controlling unit L (as designated by the add-on selection switch) as the control data therefor. For example, in the case where the add-on selection switch designates an accompaniment operation, these control data are supplied to the accompaniment controlling unit G, and where the add-on selection switch designates a description display operation, these control data are supplied to the description display controlling unit J, and where the add-on selection switch designates a picture display operation, these control data are supplied to the picture display controlling unit L. 
   A step R 5  (in  FIG. 7   b ) determines the current position of the inputted MIDI data in the progression of the music piece recognized in the step R 1  and judges whether the current position is a predetermined break-in point in the music piece progression. As long as the current position of the inputted MIDI data does not reach the break-in point, the judgment by the step R 5  is negative (NO), and goes back to the step R 5  to keep on checking. Once the current position of the user&#39;s performance reaches the break-in point in the music piece progression, the judgment by the step R 5  becomes affirmative (YES), and the process flow moves forward to a step R 6 , which instructs the designated one or ones of the accompaniment controlling unit G, the description display controlling unit J and the picture display controlling unit L to start the accompaniment and/or the description display and/or the picture display. For example, where the add-on selection switch designates an accompaniment operation, the start instruction is supplied to the accompaniment controlling unit G to start the accompaniment, and where the add-on selection switch designates a description display operation, the start instruction is supplied to the description display controlling unit J to start the description display (of the music score, the words and/or the chords), and where the add-on selection switch designates a picture display operation, the start instruction is supplied to the picture display controlling unit L to start the picture display. 
   On the other hand, when the fade-in switch is turned on in the setting controls  16 , the process flow proceeds, after the step R 4  supplying the music piece ID data, the tempo data, the transposition interval data to the control unit G, J and/or L, to a step RA as shown in dotted line (in  FIG. 7   b ) to instruct the control unit G, J and/or L to start in a fade-in fashion immediately as shown in  FIG. 6   b.    
   After the step R 6  or the step RA instructs to start the accompaniment and/or the description display and/or the picture display, a step R 7  forms the string data of “pitch and duration” pairs from the inputted MIDI data supplied from the performance data input units A-C successively, and detects the tempo and the progressing point (current position), and supplies the data representing the detected tempo and progressing point to the designated one/ones of the accompaniment controlling unit G. the description display controlling unit J and the picture display controlling unit L. Next, a step R 8  judges whether the current position of the inputted MIDI data has reached the end of the music piece, and if the judgment is negative (NO), it means the current position has not reached the end of the music piece represented by the inputted MIDI data and the process flow goes back to the step R 8  to repeat the judgment until the current position reaches the end of the music piece, i.e. until the judgment becomes affirmative (YES), successively continuing the supply of the control data to the designated controlling unit G, J and/or L. 
   Thus, the accompaniment controlling unit G, the description controlling unit J and/or the picture display controlling unit L starts in the starting fashion defined by the start instruction based on the control data supplied thereto, whereby an accompaniment, a description display (of a music score, words, chords, etc.) and/or a picture display which matches the inputted MIDI data in tempo and in progressing position is automatically started. As the progressing position of the inputted MIDI data reaches the end of the music piece, the judgment at the step R 8  becomes affirmative (YES) and the whole processing of the music recognition comes to an end. 
   Various Embodiments 
   While several preferred embodiments have been described and illustrated in detail herein above with reference to the drawings, the present invention can be practiced with various modifications without departing from the spirit of the present invention. For example, in the described embodiments, the inputted MIDI data are converted to the string data of “pitch and duration” pairs and such “pitch and duration” pairs are subject to the pattern matching processing with the “pitch and duration” pairs of the music piece data file stored in the music piece database D to recognize or identify the music piece, the comparison method is not necessarily be limited to such a method, but may be practiced by storing the music piece data files in the music piece database in the MIDI data format and comparing the inputted MIDI data per se directly with the stored music piece data files in the MIDI format. 
   Alternatively, the music piece data file in the music piece database D may be stored in another data format (e.g. a waveform characteristics data representing the characteristics of the tone waveform) than the MIDI data format and the note array pattern format and the inputted voice/sound data or the MIDI data may be converted to such another data format (e.g. waveform characteristics data) for the music piece recognition processing. The point is that the inputted MIDI data or voice/sound data has to be converted to the same data format as the data format of the music piece data files in the music piece database D to compare with each other. Any kinds of data format can be employed. 
   Further, in place of digitizing the input signals by the sound input apparatus  30  to send the digitized sound data to the sound data input interface  10 , the sound input apparatus  30  may not include a sound signal processing circuit for digitization and the sound signal per se may be sent to the sound data input interface  10 , and a further sound signal processing circuit for digitization may be provided in the electronic musical apparatus system to digitize the tone signals into tone data. 
   Although the music piece database, the accompaniment database, the musical description database and the picture database are provide as separate databases, each of the music piece data files may correspondingly include the accompaniment data, the musical description data and the picture data therein to constitute a single database. 
   While particular embodiments of the invention and particular modifications have been described, it should be expressly understood by those skilled in the art that the illustrated embodiments are just for preferable examples and that various modifications and substitutions may be made without departing from the spirit of the present invention so that the invention is not limited thereto, since further modifications may be made by those skilled in the art, particularly in light of the foregoing teachings.

US-7205268-B2,"A low-foaming aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition comprising from about 0.05% to about 6%, by weight of the composition, of certain carboxylic acid ester and/or low-degree alkoxylated derivatives thereof having HLB below about 10; from about 8% to about 80% of a surfactant; from about 15% to about 90% of water. The compositions are particularly suitable for use in front-loading laundry washing machines.","FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates to liquid laundry detergent compositions comprising certain carboxylic acid esters and/or low-degree alkoxylated derivatives thereof. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Liquid laundry detergents are popular with the consumers. For a variety of reasons it may be desirable to reduce the foaming of the liquid detergent. In recent years, for instance, front-loading laundry machines have been used. Such front-loading washing machines cannot tolerate a high degree of foaming because a front-loading washing machine depends on rotating articles in and out of the washing liquor reservoir where the surfactant removes the dirt and water brings the dirt to the bulk of washing liquor. If a high foam detergent were used, water would be distributed and become a part of foam. It results in the loss of the capability of removing the dirt to the bulk of washing liquor. In addition, some front-loading washing machines use a pump to spray washing liquor. The foam would damage the pump. Foaming is produced primarily by anionic surfactants, which have high HLB values and are included in laundry compositions to obtain particulate soil removal. Nonionic surfactants, which have a low HLB value about 12 to 13 in order to obtain an optimal detergency, are generally included for oily stain removal and are less foaming. Unfortunately, most liquid laundry detergents include anionic surfactants to obtain best performance on a variety of soils. 
     The following art describes compositions, in some instances laundry compositions, that may include various, broadly ranging carboxylic acid esters and/or alkoxylated derivatives thereof: Koester et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,384,009), Hees et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 5,753,606), WO 01/10391, WO 96/23049, WO 94/13618, Miyajima et al. (U.S. Pat. No. 6,417,146), JP 9078092, JP 9104895, JP 8157897, JP 8209193 and JP 3410880. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention includes an aqueous liquid laundry detergent composition comprising:
         (a) from about 0.05% to about 6%, by weight of the composition, of a carboxylic acid ester and/or low-degree alkoxylated derivatives thereof of formula (I):       

     
       
         
         
             
             
         
       
         
         
           
             
               
                 wherein R 1  is selected from linear or branched C 6  to C 20  alkyl or alkylene groups; 
                 R 2  is selected from C 2 H 4  or C 3 H 6  groups; 
                 R 3  is selected from CH 3 , C 2 H 5  or C 3 H 7  groups; and n has a value between 0 and 5, 
                 with the proviso that R 1 , R 2 , R 3  and n are such that HLB is below about 10; 
               
             
             (b) from about 8% to about 80% of a surfactant; 
             (c) from about 15% to about 90% of water; 
             (d) the foaming height of the composition is 75 mm or less after 5 minutes. 
           
         
       
    
     The present invention is based, in part, on the discovery that certain low-HLB (below about 10) carboxylic acid esters and low-degree alkoxylated derivatives thereof are effective defoamers for aqueous laundry detergents containing anionic surfactants. Surprisingly, these esters and/or low-degree alkoxylates thereof, despite their low HLB values, contribute to the cleaning performance of the composition, so that when these low-HLB defoamers are included, the level of surfactants in the composition may be lowered. 
    
    
     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material or conditions of reaction, physical properties of materials and/or use are to be understood as modified by the word “about.” All amounts are by weight of the liquid detergent composition, unless otherwise specified. 
     It should be noted that in specifying any range of concentration, any particular upper concentration can be associated with any particular lower concentration. 
     For the avoidance of doubt the word “comprising” is used herein in its ordinary meaning and is intended to mean “including” but not necessarily “consisting of” or “composed of.” In other words, the listed steps or options need not be exhaustive. 
     “Liquid” as used herein means that a continuous phase or predominant part of the composition is liquid and that a composition is flowable at 15° C. and above (i.e., suspended solids may be included). Gels are included in the definition of liquid compositions as used herein. 
     “HLB” as used herein is an abbreviation of Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance for a surfactant. If a surfactant has higher number of HLB, it is more hydrophilic. W. C. Griffin ( Surfactatants and Polymers in Aqueous Solution , pp. 459, K. Holmberg et al., John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.) introduced some empirical formulas to calculate HLB values for nonionic surfactants:

     In the present invention the calculations of HLB for carboxylic acid esters and/or alkoxylated derivatives thereof, Equation(4) is used to calculate the HLB. CARBOXYLIC ACID ESTERS AND LOW-DEGREE ALKOXYLATED DERIVATIVES THEREOF (also sometimes referred to herein as “ester/alkoxylated derivative thereof”). 
     The esters/alkoxylated derivatives thereof included in the present invention have the general formula (I) below: 
                         
wherein R 1  is selected from linear or branched C 6  to C 20  alkyl or alkylene groups;
 
     R 2  is selected from C 2 H 4  or C 3 H 6  groups, preferably C 2 H 4 ; 
     R 3  is selected from CH 3 , C 2 H 5  or C 3 H 7  groups, preferably CH 3 ; 
     and n has a value between 0 and 5, preferably between 0 and 4, with the proviso, however, that R 1 , R 2 , R 3  and n are such that the HLB of the ester or the alkoxylated derivative thereof is below 10, generally in the range from 1 to 10, preferably below 9. 
     For instance, HLB values calculated based on the equation (4) listed above for various ethoxylated methyl esters are as follows:

     The preferred compounds of formula (I) in the inventive compositions are selected from methyl esters derived from coconut, palm, palm kernel, tallow, soybean and rapeseed oil, as well as their ethoxylated derivates due to their availability. 
     The amount of the ester/alkoxylated derivative thereof employed in the inventive compositions is in the range of from 0.05% to 6%, preferably from 0.1% to 4%, most preferably from 0.5% to 2%. 
     Water 
     The inventive compositions are aqueous. The inventive compositions comprise generally from 15% to 90%, preferably from 30% to 80%, most preferably, to achieve optimum cost and ease of manufacturing, from 50% to 70% of water. Other liquid components, such as solvents, surfactants, liquid organic matters including organic bases, and their mixtures can be co-present. 
     Solvents that may be present include but are not limited to alcohols, surfactant, fatty alcohol ethoxylated sulfate or surfactant mixes, alkanol amine, polyamine, other polar or non-polar solvents, and mixtures thereof. 
     Surfactant 
     The compositions of the invention contain a surfactant. The overall amount of surfactant in the inventive compositions is generally in the range of from 8 to 80%, preferably from 12 to 60%, most preferably from 15 to 30%. The esters/alkoxylated derivatives thereof included in the inventive compositions surprisingly were found to contribute to the cleaning performance, in addition to lowering the foam profile of the composition. Thus the optimum overall amount of the surfactant in the composition will depend on the amount of the ester/alkoxylated derivative thereof that is present. Typically, the low-HLB ester/alkoxylated derivative of the present invention is present in an amount of from 0.06% to 35%, preferably from 2% to 30%, most preferably from 5 to 20%, optimally from 8 to 15%, by weight of the total amount of the ester/alkoxylated derivative and surfactants. 
     As used herein “surfactant” means a “detergent surfactant,” that is a molecule which has an HLB of about 12 or higher. Thus, carboxylic acid esters or alkoxylated derivatives thereof included in the present invention are not surfactants and are not included in calculating the amounts of surfactants present. 
     It is to be understood that any surfactant may be used alone or in combination with any other surfactant or surfactants. 
     Anionic Surfactant Detergents 
     Anionic surface active agents which may be used in the present invention are those surface active compounds which contain a long chain hydrocarbon hydrophobic group in their molecular structure and a hydrophilic group, i.e. water solubilizing group such as carboxylate, sulfonate or sulfate group or their corresponding acid form. The anionic surface active agents include the alkali metal (e.g. sodium and potassium) and nitrogen based bases (e.g. mono-amines and polyamines) salts of water soluble higher alkyl aryl sulfonates, alkyl sulfonates, alkyl sulfates and the alkyl poly ether sulfates. They may also include fatty acid or fatty acid soaps. One of the preferred groups of mono-anionic surface active agents are the alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl aryl sulfonates and alkali metal, ammonium or alkanolamine salts of higher alkyl sulfates or the mono-anionic polyamine salts. Preferred higher alkyl sulfates are those in which the alkyl groups contain 8 to 26 carbon atoms, preferably 12 to 22 carbon atoms and more preferably 14 to 18 carbon atoms. The alkyl group in the alkyl aryl sulfonate preferably contains 8 to 16 carbon atoms and more preferably 10 to 15 carbon atoms. A particularly preferred alkyl aryl sulfonate is the sodium, potassium or ethanolamine C 10  to C 16  benzene sulfonate, e.g. sodium linear dodecyl benzene sulfonate. The primary and secondary alkyl sulfates can be made by reacting long chain olefins with sulfites or bisulfites, e.g. sodium bisulfite. The alkyl sulfonates can also be made by reacting long chain normal paraffin hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide and oxygen as describe in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,503,280, 2,507,088, 3,372,188 and 3,260,741 to obtain normal or secondary higher alkyl sulfates suitable for use as surfactant detergents. 
     The alkyl substituent is preferably linear, i.e. normal alkyl, however, branched chain alkyl sulfonates can be employed, although they are not as good with respect to biodegradability. The alkane, i.e. alkyl, substituent may be terminally sulfonated or may be joined, for example, to the 2-carbon atom of the chain, i.e. may be a secondary sulfonate. It is understood in the art that the substituent may be joined to any carbon on the alkyl chain. The higher alkyl sulfonates can be used as the alkali metal salts, such as sodium and potassium. The preferred salts are the sodium salts. The preferred alkyl sulfonates are the C 10  to C 18  primary normal alkyl sodium and potassium sulfonates, with the C 10  to C 15  primary normal alkyl sulfonate salt being more preferred. 
     Mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl sulfates can be used as well as mixtures of higher alkyl benzene sulfonates and higher alkyl polyether sulfates. 
     The higher alkyl polyethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention can be normal or branched chain alkyl and contain lower alkoxy groups which can contain two or three carbon atoms. The normal higher alkyl polyether sulfates are preferred in that they have a higher degree of biodegradability than the branched chain alkyl and the lower poly alkoxy groups are preferably ethoxy groups. 
     The preferred higher alkyl polyethoxy sulfates used in accordance with the present invention are represented by the formula:
 
R 1 —O(CH 2 CH 2 O) p —SO 3 M,
 
where R 1  is C 8  to C 20  alkyl, preferably C 10  to C 18  and more preferably C 12  to C 15 ; p is 1 to 8, preferably 2 to 6, and more preferably 2 to 4; and M is an alkali metal, such as sodium and potassium, an ammonium cation or polyamine. The sodium and potassium salts, and polyaimines are preferred.
 
     A preferred higher alkyl poly ethoxylated sulfate is the sodium salt of a triethoxy C 12  to C 15  alcohol sulfate having the formula:
 
C 12-15 —O—(CH 2 CH 2 O) 3 —SO 3 Na
 
     Examples of suitable alkyl ethoxy sulfates that can be used in accordance with the present invention are C 12-15  normal or primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; n-decyl diethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C 12  primary alkyl diethoxy sulfate, ammonium salt; C 12  primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; C 15  primary alkyl tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; mixed C 14-15  normal primary alkyl mixed tri- and tetraethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; stearyl pentaethoxy sulfate, sodium salt; and mixed C 10-18  normal primary alkyl triethoxy sulfate, potassium salt. 
     The normal alkyl ethoxy sulfates are readily biodegradable and are preferred. The alkyl poly-lower alkoxy sulfates can be used in mixtures with each other and/or in mixtures with the above discussed higher alkyl benzene, sulfonates, or alkyl sulfates. 
     The anionic surfactant is present in an amount of from 0 to 70%, preferably at least 5%, generally from 5 to 50%, more preferably from 5 to 20%. 
     Nonionic Surfactant 
     As is well known, the nonionic surfactants are characterized by the presence of a hydrophobic group and an organic hydrophilic group and are typically produced by the condensation of an organic aliphatic or alkyl aromatic hydrophobic compound with ethylene oxide (hydrophilic in nature). Typical suitable nonionic surfactants are those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,316,812 and 3,630,929, incorporated by reference herein. 
     Usually, the nonionic surfactants are polyalkoxylated lipophiles wherein the desired hydrophile-lipophile balance is obtained from addition of a hydrophilic poly-alkoxy group to a lipophilic moiety. A preferred class of nonionic detergent is the alkoxylated alkanols wherein the alkanol is of 9 to 20 carbon atoms and wherein the number of moles of alkylene oxide (of 2 or 3 carbon atoms) is from 3 to 20. Of such materials it is preferred to employ those wherein the alkanol is a fatty alcohol of 9 to 11 or 12 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain from 5 to 9 or 5 to 12 alkoxy groups per mole. Also preferred is paraffin—based alcohol (e.g. nonionics from Huntsman or Sassol). 
     Other preferred nonionic surfactants include alkoxylated carboxylic acid esters with HLB equal or higher than 12. Preferred esters would be C 12 –C 16  with 7–10 ethylene oxide units. 
     Exemplary of such compounds are those wherein the alkanol is of 10 to 15 carbon atoms and which contain about 5 to 12 ethylene oxide groups per mole, e.g. Neodol® 25-9 and Neodol® 23-6.5, which products are made by Shell Chemical Company, Inc. The former is a condensation product of a mixture of higher fatty alcohols averaging about 12 to 15 carbon atoms, with about 9 moles of ethylene oxide and the latter is a corresponding mixture wherein the carbon atoms content of the higher fatty alcohol is 12 to 13 and the number of ethylene oxide groups present averages about 6.5. The higher alcohols are primary alkanols. 
     Another subclass of alkoxylated surfactants which can be used contain a precise alkyl chain length rather than an alkyl chain distribution of the alkoxylated surfactants described above. Typically, these are referred to as narrow range alkoxylates. Examples of these include the Neodol-1® series of surfactants manufactured by Shell Chemical Company. 
     Other useful nonionics are represented by the commercially well known class of nonionics sold under the trademark Plurafac® by BASF. The Plurafacs® are the reaction products of a higher linear alcohol and a mixture of ethylene and propylene oxides, containing a mixed chain of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide, terminated by a hydroxyl group. Examples include C 13 –C 15  fatty alcohol condensed with 6 moles ethylene oxide and 3 moles propylene oxide, C 13 –C 15  fatty alcohol condensed with 7 moles propylene oxide and 4 moles ethylene oxide, C 13 –C 15  fatty alcohol condensed with 5 moles propylene oxide and 10 moles ethylene oxide or mixtures of any of the above. 
     Another group of liquid nonionics are commercially available from Shell Chemical Company, Inc. under the Dobanol® or Neodol® trademark: Dobanol® 91-5 is an ethoxylated C 9 –C 11  fatty alcohol with an average of 5 moles ethylene oxide and Dobanol® 25-7 is an ethoxylated C 12 –C 15  fatty alcohol with an average of 7 moles ethylene oxide per mole of fatty alcohol. 
     In the compositions of this invention, preferred nonionic surfactants include the C 12 –C 15  primary fatty alcohols with relatively narrow contents of ethylene oxide in the range of from about 6 to 9 moles, and the C 9  to C 11  fatty alcohols ethoxylated with about 5–6 moles ethylene oxide. 
     Another class of nonionic surfactants which can be used in accordance with this invention are glycoside surfactants. Glycoside surfactants suitable for use in accordance with the present invention include those of the formula:
 
RO—(R 2 O) y -(Z) x 
 
wherein R is a monovalent organic radical containing from about 6 to about 30 (preferably from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; R 2  is a divalent hydrocarbon radical containing from about 2 to 4 carbons atoms; O is an oxygen atom; y is a number which can have an average value of from 0 to about 12 but which is most preferably zero; Z is a moiety derived from a reducing saccharide containing 5 or 6 carbon atoms; and x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 10 (preferably from about 1½ to about 10).
 
     A particularly preferred group of glycoside surfactants for use in the practice of this invention includes those of the formula above in which R is a monovalent organic radical (linear or branched) containing from about 6 to about 18 (especially from about 8 to about 18) carbon atoms; y is zero; z is glucose or a moiety derived therefrom; x is a number having an average value of from 1 to about 4 (preferably from about 1½ to 4). 
     Nonionic surfactants which may be used include polyhydroxy amides as discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,312,954 to Letton et al. and aldobionamides such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,389,279 to Au et al., both of which are hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application. 
     Mixtures of two or more of the nonionic surfactants can be used. 
     Generally, nonionics would comprise 0–75%, preferably 2 to 50%, more preferably 0 to 15%, most preferably 5 to 10%. The level of nonionic surfactant may be lowered compared to the typical compositions, due to the unexpected advantage of the esters/alkoxylated derivatives in the inventive compositions contribution to the oily soil removal. 
     Preferred inventive compositions comprise both anionic and nonionc surfactants, typically in a weight ratio of from 1:4 to 4:1. 
     Cationic Surfactants 
     Many cationic surfactants are known in the art, and almost any cationic surfactant having at least one long chain alkyl group of about 10 to 24 carbon atoms is suitable in the present invention. Such compounds are described in “Cationic Surfactants”, Jungermann, 1970, incorporated by reference. 
     Specific cationic surfactants which can be used as surfactants in the subject invention are described in detail in U.S. Pat. No. 4,497,718, hereby incorporated by reference. 
     As with the nonionic and anionic surfactants, the compositions of the invention may use cationic surfactants alone or in combination with any of the other surfactants known in the art. Of course, the compositions may contain no cationic surfactants at all. 
     Amphoteric Surfactants 
     Ampholytic synthetic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of aliphatic or aliphatic derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines in which the aliphatic radical may be straight chain or branched and wherein one of the aliphatic substituents contains from about 8 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one contains an anionic water-soluble group, e.g. carboxylate, sulfonate, sulfate. Examples of compounds falling within this definition are sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propionate, sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propane-1-sulfonate, sodium 2-(dodecylamino)ethyl sulfate, sodium 2-(dimethylamino)octadecanoate, disodium 3-(N-carboxymethyldodecylamino)propane 1-sulfonate, disodium octadecyl-imminodiacetate, sodium 1-carboxymethyl-2-undecylimidazole, and sodium N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-sulfato-3-dodecoxypropylamine. Sodium 3-(dodecylamino)propane-1-sulfonate is preferred. 
     Zwitterionic surfactants can be broadly described as derivatives of secondary and tertiary amines, derivatives of heterocyclic secondary and tertiary amines, or derivatives of quaternary ammonium, quaternary phosphonium or tertiary sulfonium compounds. The cationic atom in the quaternary compound can be part of a heterocyclic ring. In all of these compounds there is at least one aliphatic group, straight chain or branched, containing from about 3 to 18 carbon atoms and at least one aliphatic substituent containing an anionic water-solubilizing group, e.g., carboxy, sulfonate, sulfate, phosphate, or phosphonate. 
     Specific examples of zwitterionic surfactants which may be used are set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 4,062,647, hereby incorporated by reference. 
     Process of Making 
     The inventive compositions may be prepared by any method known to one of ordinary skill in the art. 
     The preferred process is as follows: 
     Carboxylic acid esters and alkoxylated derivatives thereof are available commercially or may be prepared the esterification of carboxylic acid and alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol to form carboxylic acid ester; the alkoxylated derivatives may be obtained by the alkoxylation of carboxylic acid ester with alkylene oxide with the presence of catalyst. Carboxylic acid esters are also widely available as “bio-diesel”. Twin River Technologies provides various types of carboxylic acid esters. Huntsman provides various alkoxylated carboxylic methyl esters. 
     Surfactants and the ester/alkoxylated derivative thereof are pre-mixed. The rest of the ingredients, if any, such as, whitening agent, functional polymers, perfume, enzyme, colorant, preservatives are then mixed to obtain an isotropic liquid. 
     Optional Ingredients 
     The inventive compositions may include additional carboxylic acid esters and/or alkoxylated derivatives thereof, in addition to theesters/alkoxylated derivatives of the present invention. 
     Builders/Electrolytes 
     Builders which can be used according to this invention include conventional alkaline detergency builders, inorganic or organic, which should be used at levels from about 0.1% to about 20.0% by weight of the composition, preferably from 1.0% to about 10.0% by weight, more preferably 2% to 5% by weight. 
     As electrolyte may be used any water-soluble salt. Electrolyte may also be a detergency builder, such as the inorganic builder sodium tripolyphosphate, or it may be a non-functional electrolyte such as sodium sulphate or chloride. Preferably the inorganic builder comprises all or part of the electrolyte. That is the term electrolyte encompasses both builders and salts. 
     Examples of suitable inorganic alkaline detergency builders which may be used are water-soluble alkalimetal phosphates, polyphosphates, borates, silicates and also carbonates. Specific examples of such salts are sodium and potassium triphosphates, pyrophosphates, orthophosphates, hexametaphosphates, tetraborates, silicates and carbonates. 
     Examples of suitable organic alkaline detergency builder salts are: (1) water-soluble amino polycarboxylates, e.g.,sodium and potassium ethylenediaminetetraacetates, nitrilotriacetatesand N-(2 hydroxyethyl)-nitrilodiacetates; (2) water-soluble salts of phytic acid, e.g., sodium and potassium phytates (see U.S. Pat. No. 2,379,942); (3) water-soluble polyphosphonates, including specifically, sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid; sodium, potassium and lithium salts of methylene diphosphonic acid; sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethylene diphosphonic acid; and sodium, potassium and lithium salts of ethane-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid. Other examples include the alkali metal salts of ethane-2-carboxy-1,1-diphosphonic acid hydroxymethanediphosphonic acid, carboxyldiphosphonic acid, ethane-1-hydroxy-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid, ethane-2-hydroxy-1,1,2-triphosphonic acid, propane-1,1,3,3-tetraphosphonic acid, propane-1,1,2,3-tetraphosphonic acid, and propane-1,2,2,3-tetraphosphonic acid; (4) water-soluble salts of polycarboxylate polymers and copolymers as described in U.S. Pat. No. 3,308,067. 
     In addition, polycarboxylate builders can be used satisfactorily, including water-soluble salts of mellitic acid, citric acid, and carboxymethyloxysuccinic acid, imino disuccinate, salts of polymers of itaconic acid and maleic acid, tartrate monosuccinate, tartrate disuccinate and mixtures thereof. 
     Sodium citrate is particularly preferred, to optimize the function vs. cost, in an amount of from 0 to 15%, preferably from 1 to 10%. 
     Certain zeolites or aluminosilicates can be used. One such aluminosilicate which is useful in the compositions of the invention is an amorphous water-insoluble hydrated compound of the formula Na x ( y AlO 2 .SiO 2 ), wherein x is a number from 1.0 to 1.2 and y is 1, said amorphous material being further characterized by a Mg++ exchange capacity of from about 50 mg eq. CaCO 3 /g. and a particle diameter of from about 0.01 micron to about 5 microns. This ion exchange builder is more fully described in British Pat. No. 1,470,250. 
     A second water-insoluble synthetic aluminosilicate ion exchange material useful herein is crystalline in nature and has the formula Na z [(AlO 2 ) y .(SiO 2 )]×H 2 O, wherein z and y are integers of at least 6; the molar ratio of z to y is in the range from 1.0 to about 0.5, and x is an integer from about 15 to about 264; said aluminosilicate ion exchange material having a particle size diameter from about 0.1 micron to about 100 microns; a calcium ion exchange capacity on an anhydrous basis of at least about 200 milligrams equivalent of CaCO 3  hardness per gram; and a calcium exchange rate on an anhydrous basis of at least about 2 grains/gallon/minute/gram. These synthetic aluminosilicates are more fully described in British Patent No. 1,429,143. 
     Enzymes 
     One or more enzymes as described in detail below, may be used in the compositions of the invention. 
     If a lipase is used, the lipolytic enzyme may be either a fungal lipase producible by  Humicola   —   lanuginosa  and  Thermomyces lanuginosus , or a bacterial lipase which show a positive immunological cross-reaction with the antibody of the lipase produced by the microorganism  Chromobacter viscosum  var.  lipolyticum  NRRL B-3673. 
     An example of a fungal lipase as defined above is the lipase ex  Humicola lanuginosa , available from Amano under the tradename Amano CE; the lipase ex  Humicola lanuginosa  as described in the aforesaid European Patent Application 0,258,068 (NOVO), as well as the lipase obtained by cloning the gene from  Humicola lanuginosa  and expressing this gene in  Aspergillus oryzae , commercially available from Novozymes under the tradename “Lipolase”. This lipolase is a preferred lipase for use in the present invention. 
     While various specific lipase enzymes have been described above, it is to be understood that any lipase which can confer the desired lipolytic activity to the composition may be used and the invention is not intended to be limited in any way by specific choice of lipase enzyme. 
     The lipases of this embodiment of the invention are included in the liquid detergent composition in such an amount that the final composition has a lipolytic enzyme activity of from 100 to 0.005 LU/ml in the wash cycle, preferably 25 to 0.05 LU/ml when the formulation is dosed at a level of about 0.1–10, more preferably 0.5–7, most preferably 1–2 g/liter. 
     Naturally, mixtures of the above lipases can be used. The lipases can be used in their non-purified form or in a purified form, e.g. purified with the aid of well-known absorption methods, such as phenyl sepharose absorption techniques. 
     If a protease is used, the proteolytic enzyme can be of vegetable, animal or microorganism origin. Preferably, it is of the latter origin, which includes yeasts, fungi, molds and bacteria. Particularly preferred are bacterial subtilisin type proteases, obtained from e.g. particular strains of  B. subtilis  and  B licheniformis . Examples of suitable commercially available proteases are Alcalase®, Savinase®, Esperase®, all of Novozymes; Maxatase® and Maxacal® of Gist-Brocades; Kazusase® of Showa Denko. The amount of proteolytic enzyme, included in the composition, ranges from 0.05–50,000 GU/mg. preferably 0.1 to 50 GU/mg, based on the final composition. Naturally, mixtures of different proteolytic enzymes may be used. 
     While various specific enzymes have been described above, it is to be understood that any protease which can confer the desired proteolytic activity to the composition may be used and this embodiment of the invention is not limited in any way be specific choice of proteolytic enzyme. 
     In addition to lipases or proteases, it is to be understood that other enzymes such as cellulases, oxidases, amylases, peroxidases and the like which are well known in the art may also be used with the composition of the invention. The enzymes may be used together with co-factors required to promote enzyme activity, i.e., they may be used in enzyme systems, if required. It should also be understood that enzymes having mutations at various positions (e.g., enzymes engineered for performance and/or stability enhancement) are also contemplated by the invention. 
     The enzyme stabilization system may comprise calcium ion; boric acid, propylene glycol and/or short chain carboxylic acids. The composition preferably contains from about 0.01 to about 50, preferably from about 0.1 to about 30, more preferably from about 1 to about 20 millimoles of calcium ion per liter. 
     When calcium ion is used, the level of calcium ion should be selected so that there is always some minimum level available for the enzyme after allowing for complexation with builders, etc., in the composition. Any water-soluble calcium salt can be used as the source of calcium ion, including calcium chloride, calcium formate, calcium acetate and calcium propionate. A small amount of calcium ion, generally from about 0.05 to about 2.5 millimoles per liter, is often also present in the composition due to calcium in the enzyme slurry and formula water. 
     Another enzyme stabilizer which may be used in propionic acid or a propionic acid salt capable of forming propionic acid. When used, this stabilizer may be used in an amount from about 0.1% to about 15% by weight of the composition. 
     Another preferred enzyme stabilizer is polyols containing only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms. They preferably contain from 2 to 6 carbon atoms and from 2 to 6 hydroxy groups. Examples include propylene glycol (especially 1,2 propane diol which is preferred), ethylene glycol, glycerol, sorbitol, mannitol and glucose. The polyol generally represents from about 0.1 to 25% by weight, preferably about 1.0% to about 15%, more preferably from about 2% to about 8% by weight of the composition. 
     The composition herein may also optionally contain from about 0.25% to about 5%, most preferably from about 0.5% to about 3% by weight of boric acid. The boric acid may be, but is preferably not, formed by a compound capable of forming boric acid in the composition. Boric acid is preferred, although other compounds such as boric oxide, borax and other alkali metal borates (e.g., sodium ortho-, meta- and pyroborate and sodium pentaborate) are suitable. Substituted boric acids (e.g., phenylboronic acid, butane boronic acid and a p-bromo phenylboronic acid) can also be used in place of boric acid. 
     One preferred stabilization system is a polyol in combination with boric acid. Preferably, the weight ratio of polyol to boric acid added is at least 1, more preferably at least about 1.3. 
     Another preferred stabilization system is the pH jump system such as is taught in U.S. Pat. No. 5,089,163 to Aronson et al., hereby incorporated by reference into the subject application. A pH jump heavy duty liquid is a composition containing a system of components designed to adjust the pH of the wash liquor. To achieve the required pH regimes, a pH jump system can be employed in this invention to keep the pH of the product low for enzyme stability in multiple enzyme systems (e.g., protease and lipase systems) yet allow it to become moderately high in the wash for detergency efficacy. One such system is borax 10H 2 O/polyol. Borate ion and certain cis 1,2 polyols complex when concentrated to cause a reduction in pH. Upon dilution, the complex dissociates, liberating free borate to raise the pH. Examples of polyols which exhibit this complexing mechanism with borax include catechol, galacitol, fructose, sorbitol and pinacol. For economic reasons, sorbitol is the preferred polyol. 
     Sorbitol or equivalent component (i.e., 1,2 polyols noted above) is used in the pH jump formulation in an amount from about 1 to 25% by wt., preferably 3 to 15% by wt. of the composition. 
     Borate or boron compound is used in the pH jump composition in an amount from about 0.5 to 10.0% by weight of the composition, preferably 1 to 5% by weight. 
     Alkalinity buffers which may be added to the compositions of the invention include monoethanolamine, triethanolamine, borax and the like. 
     The inventive compositions preferably include from 0.01% to 2.0%, more preferably from 0.05% to 1.0%, most preferably from 0.05% to 0.5% of a fluorescer. Examples of suitable fluorescers include but are not limited to derivative of stilbene, pyrazoline, coumarin, carboxylic acid, methinecyamines, dibenzothiophene-5,5-dioxide azoles, 5-, and 6-membered-ring heterocycles, triazole and benzidine sulfone compositions, especially sulfonated substituted triazinyl stilbene, sulfonated naphthotriazole stilbene, benzidene sulfone, etc. Most preferred are UV/stable brighteners (for compositions visible in transparent containers), such as distyrylbiphenyl derivatives (Tinopal® CBS-X). 
     In addition, various other detergent additives or adjuvants may be present in the detergent product to give it additional desired properties, either of functional or aesthetic nature. 
     Improvements in the physical stability and anti-settling properties of the composition may be achieved by the addition of a small effective amount of an aluminum salt of a higher fatty acid, e.g., aluminum stearate, to the composition. The aluminum stearate stabilizing agent can be added in an amount of 0 to 3%, preferably 0.1 to 2.0% and more preferably 0.5 to 1.5%. 
     There also may be included in the formulation, minor amounts of soil suspending or anti-redeposition agents, e.g. polyvinyl alcohol, fatty amides, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy-propyl methyl cellulose. A preferred anti-redeposition agent is sodium carboxylmethyl cellulose having a 2:1 ratio of CM/MC which is sold under the tradename Relatin DM 4050. 
     Additional anti-foam agents, e.g. silicon compounds, such as Silicane® L 7604, can also be added, although it is noted of course that the inventive compositions are low-foaming. 
     Bactericides, e.g. tetrachlorosalicylanilide and hexachlorophene, fungicides, dyes, pigments (water dispersible), preservatives, e.g. formalin, ultraviolet absorbers, anti-yellowing agents, such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, pH modifiers and pH buffers, color safe bleaches, perfume and dyes and bluing agents such as Iragon Blue L2D, Detergent Blue 472/572 and ultramarine blue can be used. 
     Also, additional soil release polymers and cationic softening agents may be used. 
     Preferably, the detergent composition is a colored composition packaged in the transparent/translucent (“see-through”) container. 
     Container 
     Preferred containers are transparent/translucent bottles. “Transparent” as used herein includes both transparent and translucent and means that a composition, or a package according to the invention preferably has a transmittance of more than 25%, more preferably more than 30%, most preferably more than 40%, optimally more than 50% in the visible part of the spectrum (approx. 410–800 nm). Alternatively, absorbency may be measured as less than 0.6 (approximately equivalent to 25% transmitting) or by having transmittance greater than 25% wherein % transmittance equals: 1/10 absorbancy ×100%. For purposes of the invention, as long as one wavelength in the visible light range has greater than 25% transmittance, it is considered to be transparent/translucent. 
     Transparent bottle materials with which this invention may be used include, but are not limited to: polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), polycarbonate (PC), polyamides (PA) and/or polyethylene terephthalate (PETE), polyvinylchloride (PVC); and polystyrene (PS). 
     The preferred inventive compositions which are packaged into transparent containers include an opacifier to impart a pleasing appearance to the product. The inclusion of the opacifier is particularly beneficial when the liquid detergent compositions in the transparent containers are in colored. The preferred opacifier is styrene/acrylic co-polymer. The opacifier is employed in amount of from 0.0001 to 1%, preferably from 0.0001 to 0.2%, most preferably from 0.0001 to 0.04%. 
     The container of the present invention may be of any form or size suitable for storing and packaging liquids for household use. For example, the container may have any size but usually the container will have a maximal capacity of 0.05 to 15 L, preferably, 0.1 to 5 L, more preferably from 0.2 to 2.5 L. Preferably, the container is suitable for easy handling. For example the container may have handle or a part with such dimensions to allow easy lifting or carrying the container with one hand. The container preferably has a means suitable for pouring the liquid detergent composition and means for reclosing the container. The pouring means may be of any size of form but, preferably will be wide enough for convenient dosing the liquid detergent composition. The closing means may be of any form or size but usually will be screwed or clicked on the container to close the container. The closing means may be cap which can be detached from the container. Alternatively, the cap can still be attached to the container, whether the container is open or closed. The closing means may also be incorporated in the container. 
     Method of Using Compositions 
     In use, the indicated quantity of the composition (generally in the range from 50 to 200 ml) depending on the size of the laundry load, the size and type of the washing machine, is added to the washing machine which also contains water and the soiled laundry. The inventive compositions are particularly suited for use with front-loading washing machine, due to the ability of the inventive compositions to deliver high performance with low foaming—front-loading machines require low foaming compositions. 
     The following specific examples further illustrate the invention, but the invention is not limited thereto.

     EXAMPLE 1–3 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1A 
     Examples 1 to 3 (within the scope of the present invention) demonstrated the de-foaming effect of the addition of ME relative to Comparative Example A (outside the scope of the invention). The Examples were prepared by the following procedure. 
     Premix 1 was prepared by mixing Neodol 25-9 and methyl ester at 40° C. to form a clear liquid. Water and 50% NaOH solution were added to the main mix to form a clear solution, followed by the addition of LAS acid. After the neutralization, TEA and citric acid (50% water solution), followed by sodium citrate, were added to the main mix. At last, Premix 1 was added and mixed to the main mix, followed by the addition of preservative and other ingredients. The final pH values of the batches were about 8.2. Soil removal of spaghetti sauce and the foam height were evaluated. The formulations and results that were obtained are summarized in Table 1.

     There were five levels from 0.99 to 9.89% reduction of total detergent actives (surfactants) in Examples 1 to 3 in comparison to Example A. As shown in Table 1, surprisingly, the replacement of a detergent surfactant with a non-detergent active, ME, did not reduce the detergency on spaghetti sauce but improved the overall performance. The foam reduction benefit of using ME is also evident from the results in Table 1, the more ME was used, the better the defoaming achieved. 
     EXAMPLES 4–8 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE B 
     The Examples in Table 2 were prepared by the procedure described for Examples 1–3, except that ME was replaced with 2EO EME. The formulation and results that were obtained are summarised in Table 2.

     Examples 4 to 8 (all within the scope of the present invention) had reduced level of total surfactant from 0.99 to 29.67%, respectively, relative to the Comparative Example B. Again, the replacement of a detergent surfactant with a non-detergent active, 2-EO EME did not reduce, but, surprisingly, improved the detergency on spaghetti sauce. The foam reduction benefit of using 2EO EME was also evident from the results in Table 2: the more 2EO EME was used, the better the de-foaming achieved. 
     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES C THROUGH I 
     Examples C–I (outside the scope of the invention) in Table 3 were prepared by following the procedure described for Examples 1–5, except that ME was replaced with 6(or 8)EO EME. The results that were obtained are summarised in Table 3.

US-6910186-B2,"A new class of avatars (“organizational avatars”) created in accordance with the present invention holds a value or a significance independent from their use in a virtual environment, unlike the generic avatars whose value is limited to their being used in a chatroom. For example, an organizational avatar may be in the image of a trademark (which may be copyrighted), such as Mickey Mouse, Colonel Sanders, or Pikachu (a Pokemon character). The organizational avatars may represent certain organizations, typically the organizations that own trademark and/or copyright rights to the images used to form the avatars in virtual environments. Therefore, users of virtual environments can interface various companies by interacting with organizational avatars. Alternatively, organizational avatars may represent users independent of the organization, but under a contract with the organization that owns the image the avatars depict. By using organizational avatars, companies of all sizes can increase their interactivity with customers, advertise cost effectively, and promote a positive image for their products. Tiles are used to provide faster download of a chatroom&#39;s background. Tiles also allow rapid generation of a chatroom&#39;s background, eliminating the need to use a graphics editor.","CROSS-REFERENCE TO APPENDICES ATTACHED HERETO

     BACKGROUND 
     Use of a computer for communicating online with others has recently become popular with the increased awareness by the public of the Internet and of services provided by commercial service networks. In addition to enabling access to information and exchange of messages, a link to the Internet or to a commercial service network provides an individual with the opportunity to interact with others who are connected to the network. Users of an on-line service may interact through a chat session as described in, for example, U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,731 that is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. A user typically accesses a chat service website through a personal computer of the type shown in FIG.  1 A. 
     Personal computer  30  includes a processor chassis  32  in which is mounted a floppy disk drive  34 , which is suitable for reading and writing data from and to floppy disk (now shown), and a hard drive  36  suitable for nonvolatile storage of data and executable programs. A monitor  38  is included for displaying graphics and text produced when an executable program is being run on the personal computer and for use in connection with the present invention, for displaying a graphic chat session to a user. 
     Input can be provided to personal computer  30  using either a mouse  40  for manipulating a cursor (not shown) on monitor  38 , which is used for selecting menu items and graphic controls displayed on the monitor by pressing an appropriate selection button (not shown) on the mouse, or by input entered by the user on a keyboard  50 . Optionally, processor chassis  32  includes a CD-ROM drive  47 , which is suitable for reading programs and data from a CD-ROM. To enable personal computer  30  to communicate during an online chat session, an external modem  41  is coupled to a serial port on processor chassis  32 . Optionally, a modem may be included internally within processor chassis  32 . The modem also connects to a telephone line to convey signals bi-directionally between computer  30  and a server at a remote on-line service (not shown) to which other participants in a chat session are connected in a similar fashion. 
       FIG. 1B  shows an example of a graphic chatroom as it appears on the monitor of a display device, typically a computer  30 . One or more participants in a graphic chatroom may assume an animated on-screen personality called “avatar.” For example, an avatar  9 , which represents the host of the chatroom, welcomes participants with an introductory text message  8 . In such a graphic chatroom, avatar  9  is displayed (see act  10 ) by computer  30  at an initial location on monitor  38  (FIG.  1 A), and thereafter computer  30  checks if the mouse has moved (in act  11 ), and if so, receives (in act  12 ) the new position, and transfers the new position to other computers (of other participants in the chat session), and displays (in act  13 ) the avatar in the new location on monitor  38 . Thus, a chatroom participant  20  ( FIG. 1A ) can manipulate its avatar by using the keyboard  50  and mouse  40  of his computer  30 . An avatar&#39;s response to the input appears to be real-time to a participant  20 . Manipulation of an avatar can result in not only moving an avatar from one locale to another on the screen, but also expressing emotions, dancing, sending a text message, or sleeping, among other options. 
       FIG. 2  shows a block diagram  31  in which components housed within processor chassis  32  (of  FIG. 1A ) are illustrated. A motherboard (not shown) includes a data bus  33 , which provides bi-directional communication between these components and a CPU  53 . The components include a display interface  35 , which drives monitor  38 , providing the video signals necessary to produce a graphic display during the chat session and when running other executable programs running on the personal computer. A hard drive and floppy drive interface  37  provides bi-directional communication between floppy drive  34  and hard drive  36 , and data bus  33 , enabling data and machine instructions comprising executable programs to be stored and later read into a memory  51 . Memory  51  includes both a read only memory (ROM) and random access memory (RAM). The ROM is used for storing a basic input/output operating system used in booting up personal computer  30  and other instructions essential for its operation. Machine instructions comprising executable programs are loaded into the RAM via data bus  33  to control CPU  53 . 
     A serial/mouse port  39  provides an interface for mouse  40  a data bus  33  so that signals indicative of movement of the mouse and actuation of the buttons on the mouse are input to CPU  53 . An optional CD-ROM interface  59  couples optional CD-ROM drive  47  to data bus  33  and may comprise a small computer system interface or other appropriate type of interface designed to respond to the signals output from CD-ROM drive. Optionally, a sound card  43  is connected to data bus  33  and its output is coupled to an amplifier and speaker system  52  to provide a sound capability for personal computer  30 . Output signals from keyboard  50  are connected to a keyboard interface  45 , which conveys the signals from the keyboard to data bus  33 . If external modem  41  is not used, an internal modem  54  can be provided, which is coupled directly to data bus  33 . Alternatively, external modem  41  can be connected to the data bus through a serial port of personal computer  30 . It should be noted that instead of using a conventional modem, other types of digital adapters can be used to couple personal computer  30  to a telephone line. 
     Client and server software in the Tc1/TK language to implement a graphic chatroom is available from, for example, http://openverse.org/. An example of virtual reality software for use in forming graphic chatrooms is at http://www.cs.ualberta.ca/˜graphics/MRToolkit.html that describes a MR (Minimal Reality) Toolkit for the production of virtual reality systems and other forms of three-dimensional user interfaces. 
     With the increasing use of modems operating at speeds of at least 28.8 Kbps on commercial networks, graphic chat sessions are becoming more practical. As noted above, in a graphic chat session, some or all of the participants are represented by avatars or icons that are grouped in a graphic environment or “world.” In addition to a graphic window showing the chat world, the display screen on each participant&#39;s computer commonly includes a chat pane and a message entry pane. When another user joins the chat session, the person&#39;s identifier, moniker, or name is added to a list. In some chatrooms, a number of different avatars are provided from which a participant may make a selection. Usually, a participant selects an avatar by using the keyboard  50  and/or the mouse  40  on a pop-up window of the sort depicted in FIG.  3 A. Sometimes, the participant has the opportunity to customize the avatar selected and alter the appearance of the avatar as used in various gestures or animations that can occur during a chat session. For further details on user selection of avatars, see U.S. Pat. No. 5,880,731 (incorporated by reference above). 
     Some chatrooms even allow the participants to upload (from outside of the chatroom software) a picture or icon into the chatroom, e.g. if participants see an icon they want to use as an avatar at a website. One example of such a website that has icons available for use as avatars is illustrated in  FIG. 3B  (see http://members.tripod.com/˜mYLaGe/misc2.html). Therefore, pictures that could be used as avatars include M&amp;M® characters  81  and  82  (FIG.  3 B). It is also well known to use M&amp;M® characters in PC games, such as “The Lost Formulas” available from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive. 
     Also, a user may create their own icon for use as an avatar, e.g. by use of a graphics editor such as Paint Shop Pro available from Jasc Software, Inc. 7905 Fuller Road, Eden Prairie, Minn. Legal protection for such characters is described by, for example, Pierce O&#39;Donnell in the article entitled “What You Need To Know About Character Protection—Has James Bond Made the World Safe For You?” available through the Internet at http://www.legalelite.com/articles/(a)podonnell01.htm. 
     During a graphic chat session, comments that have been transmitted by those participating in the chat session appear in a text pane or a speech balloon next to the user&#39;s avatar, and any message being entered by the user appears in another pane on the user&#39;s computer display screen. Avatars can move freely throughout sites, express themselves through gestures and body language, as well as interact with the environment by playing games, moving objects, decorating rooms, participating in presentations with other users, and making purchases from interests generated from within the chatroom. 
     In chat sessions involving a well-known person, hundreds of people may join the session, but only the host and the moderator are active in the chat session. All other participants are simply observers. However, one or more provisions may be made to display previously submitted questions from the observers for the guest. The host controls the chat session. The virtual space in which each chat session occurs is sometimes referred to as a “room” because the participants interactively communicate in the way they would communicate in a real room. 
     Typically, each participant in a graphic chatroom controls only his/her avatar in the chatroom, and each avatar in the chatroom is controlled by one participant. However, a user may acquire supervisory powers to control images on the displays. U.S. Pat. No. 5,802,296, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety, discusses power to summon another user, power to create, modify, or delete objects, and an enhanced power to change locales within the chatroom. In order to control the behaviors of avatars, some chatrooms have “acolytes” that act as a chatroom police. Avatars can page an acolyte if they encounter an offensive behavior. An acolyte can then try to reason with the offender, or mute the offender if he cannot be reasoned with. 
     An article entitled “The Psychology of Avatars and Graphical Space in Multimedia Chat Communities” by John Suler, Department of Psychology, Rider University available at http://www.rider.edu/users/suler/psycyber/psyav.html#Types discusses various types of avatars, for example “matching” avatars and “clan” avatars. Matching avatars are designed to accompany each other and indicate a connection or a bond between the members represented by the matching avatars. Clan avatars are worn by members of the same social group. Clan avatars tend to share the same basic design with slight variations to differentiate one avatar from another. As such, each user announces his/her allegiance to the clan by adopting its collective visual appearance, while also maintaining some measure of individuality. Clan avatars are found almost exclusively among adolescents for whom belonging to a peer group—and conforming to its standards—is a developmental hallmark. Considerable creativity and technical skills may go into creating matching avatars and clan avatars. 
     Online communities can be formed using Virtual Reality Markup Language (VRML). Business applications for such communities are described in, for example, “The Business Benefits of Online Communities” by Amy Oringel and Konstantin Guericke, available at http://www.vrmlsite.com/apr97/a.cgi/spot3.html. As stated therein, until recently, multi-user virtual communities were mainly considered a vehicle for gaming and entertainment. Although gaming and entertainment markets will continue to grow, a greater profitability lies in the business applications of virtual communities. Shared virtual environments provide companies with personalized communication channels that can be used for a myriad of purposes, such as reaching the target market or collaborating to develop a successful internal framework. Natural interactions in virtual environments offer a heightened experience to users and a cost-effective model to the hosts. 
     As noted in the article authored by Amy Oringel and Konstantin Guericke, companies of all sizes can use shared environments over the Internet as open communication channels with their customers. Use of the shared environments benefit the customers by providing them with a way of interacting with the company representatives in a more personalized manner than writing a letter or sending an electronic mail to a faceless employee. Likewise, use of the shared environments benefit the companies by allowing them to reach their target consumers much more easily than with an HTML site. By using the shared environments, companies may receive feedback or offer services. Furthermore, when satisfied customers share their positive experiences with a company and its products, the customers themselves become advocates for the company and its products. 
     However, the shared environments are often not as effective as a live company representative who can form a more personal bond with a potential customer than an order form. This lack of personal bond prevents shared environments from being as effective of a customer interaction channel as it can be. Customer service, shopping malls, trade shows, and sales showrooms are examples of applications that could significantly benefit from the shared virtual environments if the problem of lack of personal bond can be solved. 
     SUMMARY 
     A method and system in accordance with the invention display on a computer or television screen an image that represents a live person communicating with one or more users. Typically, at least a portion of the image is owned by an organization (also called “controlling organization”) and the use of the image is approved by the controlling organization. The organization&#39;s ownership rights in the image may arise from, for example, copyright law and/or trademark law. The controlling organization may own the copyright to a particular character, for example Superman. Also, the controlling organization may have acquired trademark rights to an image by using the image in commerce. With both copyrights and trademarks, the image may be registered with the government (e.g. with the copyright or trademark office as appropriate). 
     An image displayed on a computer screen to represent a live person communicating through a computer (or television) with (e.g. send a message to or receive a message from) other persons is hereinafter referred to as an “avatar.” As mentioned elsewhere herein, in several embodiments, an organizational avatar is owned by an organization. An organizational avatar is different from another type of avatar (hereinafter referred to as “generic avatar”) that merely represents any user in a virtual environment, in that the image of the organizational avatar holds a value or a significance that is independent from its use as an avatar. The present invention, therefore, pertains to a new class of avatars. 
     A user can interact with an organizational avatar in a number of ways. For example, a user can talk to an organizational avatar at a website or in a graphic chatroom (that may provide, for example, a first person view) without using an avatar to represent himself/herself. Alternatively, a user may use an avatar (in a chatroom that provides, for example, a third person view) to represent himself/herself. Depending on the chatroom, a user&#39;s choice of avatars may or may not be limited to generic avatars; in some embodiments, the user may not be permitted to choose an organizational avatar. A user who uses an avatar to represent himself in a chatroom may make his avatar not only express various emotions, but also make it physically interact with another avatar, for example by punching, shoving, or lifting another avatar. 
     In one embodiment, an organization uses an organizational avatar to officially represent the organization. This embodiment allows an employee of the controlling organization to communicate with customers and potential customers in the manner normally used in a graphic chatroom. Furthermore, this embodiment can be made to allow sales transactions in a conversational manner. For example, McDonalds Corporation may decide to use a RONALD McDONALD® avatar in any of the publicly available graphic chatrooms to promote McDonalds products while interacting with generic avatars. 
     In another embodiment, an organization may set up a chatroom (also called “organizational chatroom”) with a background that is related to (e.g. has the same trade dress as) its product or service, and use an organizational avatar as the host of the organizational chatroom. For example, TriCon Global Restaurants, Inc., which owns Kentucky Fried Chicken®, can set up a chatroom that has the trade dress of a Kentucky Fried Chicken® restaurant. TriCon Global Restaurants, Inc. can hire an employee to use a Colonel Sanders avatar in its organizational chatroom and talk to other users who visit the Kentucky Fried Chicken® chatroom, e.g., answer questions about ingredients and calories in meals served at the restaurant. If the organization is a business, an organizational chatroom may be used as an online shop, and an employee using an organizational avatar may enter into sales contracts with users of generic avatars, e.g. for the organization to sell goods and/or services to the users. 
     The backgrounds for organizational chatrooms can be designed using tiles, which are picture fragments that can be arranged like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle on a computer or television screen to create a background. A chatroom software that uses tiles for the background has an archive of different types of tiles. Any number of each type of tile can be retrieved from the archive and placed on the desired spot of a computer or television screen to create a background. Use of tiles can reduce the file size for expressing various backgrounds by several times (e.g. can reduce to {fraction (1/10)}) as compared to prior art backgrounds. 
     In yet another embodiment, a controlling organization permits the use of organizational avatars, such as avatars of M&amp;M® figures or Barbie dolls, to participants other than the controlling organization. For example, all users of a graphic chatroom may be represented by avatars owned by a single organization. An organization may allow users to use the organizational avatars free of charge for the purpose of familiarizing the user(s) with the particular products represented by organizational avatars. By familiarizing the user(s) with the products of the controlling organization, the organization effectively advertises its products. Depending on the business model, free usage of organizational avatars may be allowed indefinitely, may be allowed only prior to the release of a related product, or may be allowed a limited number of times (or over a limited duration). 
     In another implementation of the above embodiment, a graphic chatroom requires the user to enter a password which the user can only obtain by purchasing a product or service of the organization that operates the chatroom. The chatroom software may, for example, require that the user enter a unique number imprinted on a hidden portion of the packaging of a product. Users that are unable to enter such a password may be limited to using generic avatars (selected from a predetermined list), or may not even be allowed to enter the chatroom. A restriction in the use of organizational avatars that apply only to non-owners of the corresponding products induces those who are familiar with the avatars to purchase the products. Moreover, having a doll on hand in the real world and using the corresponding avatar online provides a child with a novel touch that is not available to prior art users of graphic chatrooms. 
     Although an organizational avatar may be used in a graphic chatroom, its use is not limited to graphic chatrooms. A controlling organization, such as McDonalds Corporation, may wish to use one of its avatars, for example an avatar of RONALD McDONALD®, in its website. In addition, real-time online communication methods, such as America Online Instant Messenger, may eventually become graphic and implement organizational avatars. Since the image of RONALD McDONALD® is already familiar to many McDonalds® customers, a RONALD McDONALD® avatar can be effectively used as a spokesperson for McDonalds Corporation. 
     Organizational avatars provide organizations with increased connectivity and interactivity with their customers, thereby providing a cost-effective way of marketing and advertising. For example, whereas employees in McDonalds restaurants only focus on selling the various food items on the menu, a RONALD McDONALD® avatar promotes goodwill and collects data from customers in addition to selling the menu items online. Organizational avatars are especially cost-effective when they reside in the Internet which is accessible worldwide, although organizational avatars as described herein can also be distributed on storage media, such as CD-ROMs. Through organizational avatars, companies can market their product or collect data from all over the world. With online activities becoming more prevalent among children and teens, companies that target younger age groups are especially likely to benefit from organizational avatars.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     The present invention pertains to a new class of avatars. Unlike the generic prior art avatars that are valuable only because they represent live persons in a shared virtual environment, the new class of avatars (“organizational avatars”) in accordance with the present invention holds a value or a significance independent from their use in a virtual environment. Unlike a generic avatar that is normally created by an artist for use by any person in a chatroom, one embodiment of an organizational avatar is in the image of a trademark, such as Mickey Mouse, Colonel Sanders, or Pikachu (a Pokemon character), or a widely recognized symbol, such as Santa Claus. Such organizational avatars represent certain organizations, typically the organizations that own rights to the images of the avatars, in virtual environments. Therefore, users of virtual environments can interface various companies by interacting with those companies&#39; organizational avatars. By using organizational avatars, companies of all sizes can increase their interactivity with customers, advertise cost effectively, and promote a positive image for their products. 
     A method and system in accordance with the invention display (e.g., as illustrated by act  122  of  FIG. 4B ) on a screen  111  ( FIG. 4A ) of a computer  110  (that is similar or identical to computer  30  described above, unless noted otherwise) an image  112  that represents a live person transferring information (as illustrated by act  123  of  FIG. 4B ) to/from one or more users. In one embodiment, the live person enters into a contract with an owner of image  112 , for use of image  112 . In an example illustrated in  FIG. 4A , image  112  is of Colonel Sanders who founded the Kentucky Fried Chicken® business, and who served as its spokesperson when he was alive. The person using image  112  as an avatar (also called “organizational avatar”) has a contract (as per act  121  of  FIG. 4B ) with the Kentucky Fried Chicken® business (e.g. with TriCon Global Restaurants, Inc. which owns the business Kentucky Fried Chicken® In some embodiments, image  112  that is used to form an avatar is of a character that represents one of: a person (e.g. Ronald McDonald), an animal (e.g. Mickey Mouse), or a thing (e.g. a rocking chair). In certain embodiments, image  112  is not limited in any manner, and in fact can be any image whatsoever (e.g. can be real and/or imaginary). 
     Depending on the embodiment, image  112  may be received (see act  126  of  FIG. 4B ) by computer  110  either over the Internet (e.g. from a website of the controlling organization that requires the user of computer  110  to enter into the contract, which may be, for example, a click-wrap agreement), or from a computer readable storage medium (e.g. that is packaged in a shrinkwrap that requires the user to enter into a shrink-wrap agreement). Preferably, but not necessarily, computer  110  receives software (such as a chatroom client or a 3D browser) from the controlling organization in the same manner as image  112 . Such software may include a feature that prevents use of image  112  outside of the software (e.g. to permit only use of image  112  as authorized by the agreement). For example, the software may be a graphic chatroom software that permits use of image  112  only with a server computer operated by the controlling organization. Alternatively, the software may be in the form of JAVA bytecodes that include image  112 , so that image  112  is inaccessible when the software is not being used. As yet another alternative, the image may be made usable only with the software sold or provided by the particular organization that creates and controls certain chatrooms. 
     An implementation may also be set up so that image  112  is simply located (without any protection, such as encryption) in an appropriate directory in computer  110  that relates to the application software (e.g. C:\ProgramFiles\OpenVerse\) in case of OpenVerse. In such an implementation, misuse of image  112  is not prevented by an engineering mechanism, and instead legal remedies are used to prevent misuse. In one such implementation, the only difference between a prior art system and a system of this invention is the specific use of image  112 . As noted elsewhere, use of image  112  may be restricted via software mechanisms, depending on the various embodiments. For example, if image  112  is to be used only by the owner of image  112 , then software of the prior art is modified so that (1) the choices of avatars that are available to users is limited to a predetermined list that only allows selection of a generic avatar and (2) the choices of avatars that are available to the owner of image  112  includes at least the image  112 . In the latter case, if more than one user choose the same avatar to represent himself/herself with, the software automatically makes adjustments, for example in hair color or the color of the shirt, in order to avoid the presence of identical avatars in a shared environment. 
     In one embodiment, image  112  is displayed by a browser in the users&#39; computers, and access to image  112  is provided through websites that are trusted by users, such as the organization&#39;s website, a virtual mall (that provides access to a number of such chatrooms), or a directory service (such as YAHOO®). Providing access to image  112  from trusted websites provides an assurance to the users (who use such access) that they are dealing with the genuine organization, and not with an unknown entity. Depending on the implementation, digital certificates may be used to improve confidence of such users. 
     Depending on the embodiment, image  112  may be a line drawing, a picture, or just portions of such a drawing/picture that together form a trade-dress. An organization&#39;s ownership rights in such an image  112  may arise from, e.g. copyright law and/or trademark law. Preferably, but not necessarily, the organization (or owner) registers image  112  with the government, e.g. in the copyright office or the trademark office. Registration of image  112 , if performed by the controlling organization, can be performed at any time relative to acts  121 - 123  (described above), depending on the embodiment. Moreover, image  112  need not be registered, and may be a character (such as Superman) that is owned, as per copyright law, by the organization as discussed below in reference to FIG.  10 A. Note that such a character need not be owned by the organization in another embodiment, as discussed below in reference to FIG.  11 A. In one embodiment, image  112  is used in commerce (as illustrated by act  125  in  FIG. 4B ) to acquire ownership rights (e.g. as per trademark law), even though not registered. 
     For example, image  112  may have been used to identify the organization itself (e.g. in an advertisement in the real world, such as a billboard or newspaper advertisement), as in the case of the image of Colonel Sanders that is used with the initials “KFC” to represent the Kentucky Fried Chicken® restaurant. As another example, image  112  may have been used to identify a product (or service) provided by the organization, and to distinguish from the product (or service) from others (e.g. on a store shelf), as in the case of an image of a Coke® bottle (which is a product in the real world) which may be used as an avatar to represent the Coca-Cola Company. Therefore, a trade dress of an organization (which is acquired by use of a packaging or design of a product (or service) either in the real world or in the on-line world to identify source) may also be used to form image  112 . Note that for simplicity the examples refer to registered trade marks that are well recognized, although as noted above the trade marks need not be registered. 
     As yet another example, image  112  may have been used to indicate a source of a product or service even if that source is unknown, as in the case of an image of Mr. Clean (which may be used as an avatar) used to indicate a source of “Mr. Clean Wipes-Ups” Kitchen wipes and Bathroom wipes, although users may not know that Mr. Clean is a mark of Proctor and Gamble. As still another example, image  112  may identify a level of quality of a product or service, e.g. as in the case of “Mr. Clean Wipes-Ups.” As yet another example, image  112  may be a symbol that invokes goodwill among the users, again as in the case of Mr. Clean. Another example of image  112  that evokes goodwill is the image of RONALD McDONALD™ (a statue of which is commonly found in McDonald&#39;s restaurants), that may be used as described herein to represent on a computer screen a real live customer service representative of McDonald&#39;s Corporation. Therefore, depending on the embodiment, an image that is used to form an organizational avatar as described herein includes but is not limited to an image protected by the Lanham Act (the Trademark Act of 1946), as defined at, for example, 15 U.S.C. § 1127 that is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. 
     This invention does not cover use of an image  112  as an avatar by a person not authorized by the controlling organization, if image  112  is owned by the controlling organization. Instead, the controlling organization has a contract with the person (that is being represented by the avatar), who may be, for example, (1) an employee (or contractor) that represents the organization to the user or (2) another user, e.g. of software provided by the organization to advertise products or services to such users. Use of such an image  112  by an unauthorized person may be prosecuted by the controlling organization under other legal theories, such as trade mark, trade dress, right of publicity and unfair competition (e.g. misrepresentation) laws. 
     In one embodiment, an organization uses an organizational avatar to officially represent the organization, e.g. in a graphic chatroom accessed from the organization&#39;s website. Software for such a graphic chatroom may be automatically downloaded into computer  110  ( FIG. 4A ) in the form of JAVA bytecodes, as soon as a user indicates an interest in interacting with a live person when visiting the organization&#39;s website. Alternatively, the organization&#39;s chatroom may be a portion of a virtual mall, and software for the virtual mall may be already loaded in computer  110 . 
     Such graphic chatroom software causes a number of computers  110 A- 110 N (wherein A≦I≦N. N being the total number of users) to have an identical display on their respective monitors as illustrated in FIG.  4 C. Each of the corresponding users  20 A- 20 N that operate the respective computers  110 A- 110 N is represented in the display by a corresponding avatar  120 A- 120 N. Avatars (also called “generic avatars”)  120 A- 120 N may be formed by images that are not identified with any specific organization, product or service as per trademark law, and that are not characters of the type protected as per copyright law (e.g. not owned by an organization other than the controlling organization). For example, avatars  120 A- 120 N may be formed as stick figures as illustrated in FIG.  4 C. 
     In addition to generic avatars  120 A- 120 N, the display includes at least one organizational avatar  120 Q that represents another user  20 Q who is a spokesperson for the controlling organization. Therefore, in this embodiment there are two classes of avatars: organizational avatars used by organizations, and generic avatars used by users. So, an employee of a business, and customers (or potential customers) communicate with one another (send and receive messages) in the manner normally used in a graphic chatroom, and transact business in a conversational manner. 
     Use of organizational avatar  120 Q to conduct business allows an organization&#39;s employee to  20 Q evoke good will of users  20 A- 20 N for the organization, as compared to use of a generic avatar  120 I that does not evoke such feeling. Moreover, unlike the real world, user  20 Q&#39;s physical characteristics (such as race, gender, clothing, and physical handicap) are hidden from users  20 A- 20 N, thereby to provide a more uniform experience to users  20 A- 20 N, regardless of which employee of the organization is acting as user  20 Q. Also, use of a graphic chatroom to conduct business provides customers with a real-world feel, e.g. because customers can discuss their common problems amongst themselves. Therefore, use of an organizational avatar  20 Q in a graphic chat room as described herein provides advantages&#39; of both, the real world and the on-line world. 
     In the embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 4C , a server computer  130  is programmed with chat software  131  to assist in transfer of information (as illustrated by act  123  of  FIG. 4B ) among computers  120 A- 120 N and a computer  120 Q that is operated by user  20 Q. In an alternative embodiment illustrated in  FIG. 4E , such a server computer is not used and instead, an organizational computer  139 Q communicates directly with user computer  1391  (note that there may be any number of such user computers). Such direct communication (without server computer  130 ) may take place via the Internet, or may also be via dial-up into computer  139 Q. 
     Server computer  130  ( FIG. 4C ) maintains local buffers  132 A- 132 N and  132 Q to hold data related to corresponding users  20 A- 20 N and  20 Q. During operation, computer  120 Q may receive a message or mouse movement (or a clickstream of arrow keys) from user  20 Q (as illustrated by act  133  in  FIG. 4D ) and transmit this information to server computer  130  (FIG.  4 C). Server computer  130  in turn saves this information in its memory (e.g., in a memory location specific to user  20 Q), and supplies the information (as illustrated by act  134  in  FIG. 4D ) to all users (e.g. to each of computers  120 A- 120 N that update their respective displays in the normal manner). In one embodiment, a user computer  120 Q updates the display locally, so as to make the avatar responses to mouse movements appear more realtime than if the update is performed through a server. 
     In the embodiment just described, chat software  131  in computer  130  ( FIG. 4C ) is programmed to permit one or more of users  120 A- 120 N to be “black-listed” by user  120 Q. For example, a user  1201  may be black-listed if s/he misbehaves by making obscene comments. Instead of being “black-listed,” users may be simply “muted” wherein only messages from such users are blocked. Depending on the embodiment, users that are muted may be allowed to “whisper.” Users may be “muted” for reasons other than misbehavior, e.g. if there is insufficient room (i.e. the number N of users exceeds a predetermined maximum that can be serviced by a single employee  20 Q, an example of such a maximum is 10). In one embodiment, users have to wait their turn to speak with an organizational avatar, and are automatically “muted” upon entry into the graphic chatroom. Only a user whose turn it is to speak is “un-muted” As in the normal manner, users that are muted and/or black-listed can observe everything in the graphic chat room, but cannot participate in the discussion. 
     When a user is being black-listed, computer  120 Q receives (as illustrated by act  135  in  FIG. 4D ) from user  20 Q an instruction about black-listing of user  20 A, and transmits the instruction to computer  130 . Computer  130  informs user  20 A about being black-listed, and updates a database of black-listed users (e.g. may mark in memory region  132 A that user is black-listed). Similar acts are performed to remove a user from the black-list. Users  20 A- 20 N communicate with one another in the normal manner of a graphic chatroom. For example, a computer  12 ON receives (see act  137  in  FIG. 4D ) a message, emotion, mouse movement or other such information from user  20 N and transfers this information to server  130 . Server  130  checks (see act  138 ) the database to see if user  20 N that generated the information is black-listed, and if not transfers the information to all of computers  120 A- 120 N and computer  120 Q. 
     In one embodiment, computers  130  and  120 Q are both owned and operated by the controlling organization. Therefore, the functionality of these two computers can be combined into a single computer to yield the architecture illustrated in FIG.  4 D. Alternatively, computer  120 Q may be the only computer owned and/or operated by the controlling organization, and server computer  130  may be owned and/or operated by a service provider (in which case the organization need not deal with operation and maintenance of computer  130 ). 
     In one implementation of the embodiment just described, an organization operates a chatroom (also called “organizational chatroom”) having a background  141  ( FIG. 5A ) that is related to (e.g. has the same trade dress as or contains a trade mark of) the product or service the organization offers, and an image  142  that has a similar relation (which is used as an organizational avatar). For example, TriCon Global Restaurants, Inc. (“TriCon”) may set up a chatroom with a Kentucky Fried Chicken® restaurant in its background and hire an employee to talk to other users by using a Colonel Sanders avatar  142 . If an embodiment requires that organizational avatars be used only with the software of a specific chatroom service provider, TriCon may hire the chatroom service provider to create a chatroom with a Kentucky Fried Chicken® restaurant in its background. Optionally, TriCon may have the chatroom service also provide one or more organizational avatars for the chatroom. 
     When setting up a chatroom that can accommodate organizational avatars, the background can be built using a number of tiles  140 A- 140 N (wherein A≦I≦N, N being the total number of tiles) and objects  144 A- 144 Z that are displayed over such tiles, as shown in FIG.  5 B. Tiles  140 A- 140 N are graphic segments that can be arranged to depict the desired background. Each tile  140 I can be either the same as or different from another tile  140 J. Such tiles can be selected to form a background  148  ( FIG. 5C ) from a list  149  (also in  FIG. 5C ) that shows tiles of various colors and patterns. Each tile  140 I occupies a spot on the computer or television screen, as depicted by the rectangles  146  in FIG.  5 C. Like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, such tiles in combination with each other, make a complete background. For example, in  FIG. 5B , a one-tree tile  140 A, two-tree tile  140 B are shown arranged alternating with one another to form a row  147  to depict a snow-covered field. Objects  144 A- 144 Z (wherein A≦I≦Z. Z being the total number of objects) such as small landmarks  144 A or snowman  144 B can be placed on top of the tiles to embellish the background. Various avatars  120 A- 120 R move around on top of such a background. 
     A tiled background as illustrated in  FIG. 5C  can be constructed, simply by clicking on a tile in list  149  and then clicking at a location in window  150  where the tile is to be placed. In this manner, an entire background can be quickly and easily constructed by any person, without the need to learn and use a conventional graphics editor. Furthermore, such tiled backgrounds can be downloaded more quickly than a conventional background in the form of an image in a single “.jpg” or “.gif” file. For example, if a single tile were used repeatedly at each of a number of locations of a background, to form the entire background consisting of 100 tiles, the speed to download the single tile is 100 times faster. Although a user computer  139 I needs to make 100 copies of the single tile to form the image, with the speed advantage of personal computers (PCs), the incremental time may not even be noticeable by a user. If a number of tiles are used to form a 100 tile background, the speed advantage is proportionately reduced, but is still several times faster than downloading an entire background as a single image. 
     Tiles  140 A- 140 N and objects  144 A- 144 M is well suited for use with organizational avatars of the type described herein. First, tiles in a background are easy to change without having to redraw the entire background, making them ideal for advertisements that change over time. For example, a tile having the letter “M” to advertise McDonalds can be replaced with another tile having the letters “KFC” to advertise Kentucky Fried Chicken. In a similar manner, if a billboard  145  in  FIG. 5B  is an object  144 , it can simply be replaced with another object. Alternatively, if billboard  145  is formed of a set of individual tiles, that set of tiles (that make up billboard  145 ) can be replaced with different tiles to change the content of the billboard. Therefore, by simply replacing few tiles of the background, a chatroom service provider can customize the background to accommodate different organizations (e.g. the same background can be used with both KFC and McDonalds, if appropriate tiles are replaced). Also, using tiles dramatically reduces the size of the files needed to create backgrounds because the same tile  140  can be chosen as many times as necessary to create the desired background. The memory space that has been freed by the file size reduction can then be used to store a greater variety of tiles, broadening the tile options for background. 
     As illustrated by act  151 , talking between two or more live persons as described herein takes place by the computer&#39;s transferring messages  143 . In one embodiment, message  143  is about the organization or its product/service, e.g. solicitation of users to work at the restaurant, or answers to questions about ingredients and calories in meals served at the restaurant, recommendation of certain items on the menu. In another embodiment, message  143  is not about the organization, e.g. may be about current topics in the news (such as the Florida election and changes to the electoral college). Depending on the employee&#39;s behavior, Colonel Sanders avatar  142  may even walk with a user (not shown) into restaurant  141 , and in response, the background changes to depict the inside, rather than the outside, of a Kentucky Fried Chicken® restaurant. 
     If the organization is a business, such a chatroom may be used as an on-line shop, and an employee using an organizational avatar may enter into sales contracts with users using generic avatars, e.g. for the organization to sell goods and/or services to the users. In the just-described example, Colonel Sanders avatar  142  may take an order (in act  152  of  FIG. 5B ) from a user. Optionally, the user may be provided with a menu for selection of a payment method (wherein the user can select, for example, to pay with a credit card number, or choose to pay upon delivery). Alternatively, the default method could be payment on delivery, and the user may be simply informed of this payment method. Thereafter, the ordered item is delivered (as illustrated by act  153 ) in real life, to the user&#39;s address. Depending on the implementation, one or more portions of information about the user that are used to form such a sales contract may be already on file with the organization, in which case the user may simply order selected items from the menu, without being required to provide any further input. 
     Of course, as would be apparent to the skilled artisan, other businesses may also be operated in this manner. As another example, a sports team may set up a chatroom decorated with the sports team&#39;s colors, and use an avatar that resembles the sports team&#39;s mascot(s) (such as ACE and DIAMOND in case of Toronto Blue Jays illustrated in  FIG. 5E ) as host(s) in the chatroom, e.g. to sell sports paraphernalia and tickets for the next game. Thus, instead of physically going to or telephoning a business&#39;s office or store, a customer can simply use their personal computer to make a purchase, ask questions, or take care of a problem. 
     In the examples illustrated in  FIGS. 5A and 5E , no generic avatars are shown, because these examples illustrated chatrooms that provide a first person view and the user does not use an avatar. Moreover, in these examples, there are either (1) no other users, or (2) other users are black-listed and not visible, or (3) the software supports only one-on-one communication (between organizational avatar(s) and a single user). However, in a more typical example illustrated in  FIG. 6A , the chatroom software provides a third person view, and the user&#39;s choice of avatars is limited to generic avatars (such as avatars  161  and  162 ). As noted above, in this example as well, the user is not permitted to choose organizational avatar  163  which is used only by the organization&#39;s spokesperson. Depending on the embodiment, avatars  161 - 163  ( FIG. 6A ) may or may not be animated. A generic avatar that is animated allows a user to interact with an organizational avatar not just by text and sound, but also by movement of limbs and/or gestures. Animated avatars can play games using graphic objects, push or punch each other, or make faces at each other, among other activities. A computer can effectively make an avatar appear to move by switching rapidly between different images used to represent the same avatar. For example, an avatar can be made to execute a series of punches by switching rapidly between the two images  168 ,  169  in FIG.  6 B. 
     Specifically, RONALD McDONALD avatar  163  in a chatroom  164  modeled after a McDonalds(&amp; playroom entertains users, by playing a game with avatars  161  and  162 . In this manner, the controlling organization (e.g. McDonald&#39;s Corporation) uses its chatroom ( FIG. 6A ) to improve public relations, to promote a positive attitude toward its products not only in the minds of young participants who play with Ronald McDonald in the chatroom, but also in the minds of those children&#39;s parents. The value of organizational avatars as a public relations tool is further enhanced by the fact that the avatars can entertain the chatroom participants in a myriad of ways. An organizational avatar  163  can play games using various objects, sing and dance, participate in a race, or perform a magic show. Therefore, chatroom  164  ( FIG. 6A ) serves a purpose other than substituting for a physical store (as described above in reference to FIGS.  5 A and  5 E). 
     In the example illustrated in  FIG. 6A , avatar  163  uses a ball  165  to play a game with avatars  161  and  162 . Therefore, a chatroom can be set up to include objects, sounds, or any other embellishment that augment the chatroom&#39;s appeal. Ball  165  is automatically controlled by server  130  (FIG.  4 C), in response to movements by avatars  161 - 163 . For example, server computer  130  computes (in act  171  of  FIG. 6C ) the new position of the ball based on the movement and location of an avatar, and based on location of wall or other obstacle in chatroom  164  (FIG.  6 A). Next, in act  172 , computer  130  checks if the new position interferes with the current position of an avatar, wall or other obstacle, and if so returns to act  171  and if not goes to act  173 . In act  173 , computer  130  displays the ball at the new position. Thereafter, computer  130  goes to act  174  to check for movement of an avatar, and if so goes to act  171  and otherwise returns to act  173 . Note that computer  130  may implement act  174  by simply waiting on avatar movement, instead of actively checking. 
     In order to express an emotion, a user selects the “Avatar” item in the menu bar ( FIG. 6A ) to open a drop down list box, and selects the “Emotion” item which opens up another list box  166 . Box  166  allows the user to select any of a number of emotions, such as happy, sad, angry, bored, and punch. Avatar  162  is illustrated in  FIG. 6A  after selection of the “bored” emotion. In one embodiment, the two classes of avatars (organizational and generic) have different behavioral options. A controlling organization may, for instance, limit the ability of ,organizational avatar  163  to express certain emotions (such as anger and sadness), although generic avatars  161  and  162  are permitted the full range of emotions. Limiting organizational avatar  163 &#39;s behavior options reduces the likelihood of a user  20 Q ( FIG. 4C ) offending customers, and reducing the good will associated with organizational avatar  163 . For example, the “punch” option in the menu  166  may be disabled for the organizational avatar  163 , but not for other users because punching other user avatars might adversely affect McDonalds&#39; image. Also, as noted above, organizational avatar  163  may have the ability to override the commands of users, e.g. mute problematic users. An organization that is concerned about maintaining order in its chatroom may automatically record all activities in a chatroom, for playback by a supervisor of user  20 Q ( FIG. 4C ) in case of complaints about user  20 Q. In addition to emotions, a user may choose to whisper (as discussed elsewhere), sleep or morph. 
     Although  FIGS. 5A and 6A  illustrate use of an organizational avatar with a background that is also owned by the controlling organization, other kinds of backgrounds can also be used in a graphic chatroom. For example,  FIGS. 5E and 7A  illustrate chatrooms that have no background. In each of  FIGS. 5E and 7A , the respective messages from organizational avatars  175  and  176  are related to their organization, as illustrated by act  181  in FIG.  7 B. Also, as illustrated in  FIG. 7A , a text pane  177  may be used to display the message “do you know how many different M&amp;M colors there are” from M&amp;M character  176 . Note that avatars  176  and  161  are being used by real live persons to talk to one another in real time. Depending on the embodiment, instead of text messages, voice recordings or even live speech may be exchanged by such users. 
     Also, just like any other avatar, an organizational avatar can participate in a chat session that is not hosted by an owner of the organizational avatar (such chat session is hereinafter “generic chat session”). For example, Colonel Sanders avatar  142  can enter a chatroom having a generic background that is unrelated to Kentucky Fried Chicken®, if this generic chatroom is accessible from the Kentucky Fried Chicken®t chatroom of  FIG. 5A  (e.g. in case of a virtual mall). In the example illustrated in  FIG. 7C , server computer  130  displays (see act  182  in  FIG. 7B ) such an unrelated background, although displaying (see act  183 ) organizational avatar  142 . Generic avatars  161  and  162  may also enter this chatroom (FIG.  7 C), if the McDonald&#39;s chatroom ( FIG. 6A ) is also part of the virtual mall. In the example illustrated in  FIG. 7C , Colonel Sanders avatar  142  is providing directions to the nearest KFC, although such an organizational avatar may discuss topics that are unrelated to the organization (such as news events, politics, sports, history etc) in the manner of discussions in the real world. 
     Note that a chatroom having a background of one organization can be entered by an organizational avatar of another organization, so that the two organization target the same group of consumers, e.g. in case of a virtual mall of the type described above. Therefore, if M&amp;M&#39;s® were targeting the same group of customers as Kentucky Fried Chicken®, an agreement to allow each other&#39;s organizational avatars in their respective chatrooms would be an effective marketing strategy. In the example illustrated in  FIG. 8A , organizational avatar  176  belonging to M&amp;M® Corporation shows a generic avatar  167 , the way to the M&amp;M® chatroom, from the chatroom of Kentucky Fried Chicken®. In such a case, server computer  130  displays the trademark avatar of M&amp;M® corporation (in act  184  of FIG.  8 A), background image  141  of Kentucky Fried Chicken® (in act  185 ), and generic avatar  167  (in act  186 ). When a user in control of organizational avatar  176  provides a message  188  (FIG.  8 B), server computer  130  receives the message and transmits the message to the user in control of generic avatar  167 . 
     In another embodiment, an organization uses (see act  192  in  FIG. 8D ) a character from the public domain to form an avatar.  FIG. 8C , for example, shows a Santa Claus avatar  191  in an organizational chatroom  196  accessible through the organization&#39;s website. An employee of an organization, for example a Christmas store, uses avatar  191  to speak about Santa Claus, about being at the North Pole, and that it&#39;s only 10 days to Christmas. Additionally, the avatar  191  may talk about products/services of the Christmas store to visitors of the website (see act  193  in FIG.  8 D). Depending on the implementation, the products and/or services may be related to the character (e.g. Christmas gifts in case of Santa Claus). Optionally, there may be other avatars in the form of various creatures or objects related to Christmas, such as elves, candy canes, and reindeers. Depending on the implementation, users may or may not be able to use one of those Christmas avatars to interact with the Santa Clause avatar  191 . With or without using an avatar, the user sends and/or receives messages that are related to Christmas or to the organization&#39;s products/services (see act  194 ). Finally, the information exchange can result in a sale of product/service by the organization (see act  195 ). 
     Such use of a well-known character as an organizational avatar has the advantage of receiving instant goodwill from visitors who may not be knowledgeable about the organization. Furthermore, the organization may promote its organizational avatar in the mind of the user, e.g. by displaying the image of the avatar at points of sale, and by advertisement and publicity. Such activities may cause the image to achieve “secondary meaning” (the public associates the image with the organization), so that over time an organizational avatar formerly from the public domain now becomes a trade mark of the organization. 
     In an alternative embodiment, all users of a graphic chatroom are represented by a corresponding number of avatars from a single organization, and each user enters into a contract with the organization for use of the corresponding image (that is owned by the organization). Depending on the implementation, such images may have a common theme. In one example illustrated in  FIG. 9A , a graphic chatroom  200  entitled “BARBIE” is made available at the website www.barbie.com, and allows users to appear as any one of a number of organizational avatars  201 A- 201 N that each have the same image as the corresponding BARBIE® dolls, such as dolls named Barbie, Christie, Kira and Teresa. 
     In one implementation of the alternative embodiment, an organization uses a number of images (e.g. that are to be used for avatars  201 A- 201 N) to identify products or services of the organization (see act  211  in FIG.  9 B). Thereafter, a number of users (e.g. that are represented by avatars  201 A- 201 N) contract (as illustrated by act  212 ) with the organization to use such images in their computers. Next, each computer displays (see act  213 ) the images to represent the users, as illustrated in FIG.  9 A. Thereafter, server computer  130  programmed with graphic chatroom software  131  transfers (see act  214  in  FIG. 9B ) messages (and any other information, such as gestures, movement etc) between the users, in the above-described manner, so that children across the world can become friends. The just-described graphic chatroom of the alternative embodiment may be designed with a background appropriate for the corresponding avatars (see act  215  in FIG.  9 B), e.g. may contain furniture of a BARBIE® doll house, and may be in pink color. 
     In one implementation, one or more users are allowed to use such avatars free of charge, so as to familiarize the user(s) with the corresponding products, thereby to serve as an advertisement for the products. Depending on the embodiment, all avatars used in a chatroom may share a common theme, e.g., all of the avatars can be in the image of BARBIE® dolls. In one embodiment, all avatars are owned by the same organization, such as avatars in the image of Mickey Mouse, Lion King, and Snow White, all of which are owned by Disney. In the above-described example, the chatroom software may allow users to use avatars of newly-released or yet-to-be-released BARBIE® dolls, so that users purchase these dolls after using the corresponding avatars (see act  216  of FIG.  9 B). Depending on the business model, free usage of organizational avatars may be allowed indefinitely, or may be allowed only prior to release of a related product, or may be allowed a limited number of times (or over a limited duration). 
     In another implementation of the alternative embodiment, the user must purchase such a product prior to use of the organizational avatar. For example, the contract described above in reference to act  212  may be formed at the same time that the organization sells a product or service to the user (as illustrated by act  217 ). Thereafter, each computer checks (see act  218 ) if a purchase has occurred. For example, in a character selection screen (see FIG.  9 C), the user may be required to enter a password in box  221 , and the password may be available only on purchase of a BARBIE® doll. Such a password may be imprinted on a hidden portion of the packaging of the BARBIE® doll, so that the user must open the packaging to retrieve the doll and the password. 
     The password may be generic, thereby to allow a user to use any of the various BARBIE® avatars. Alternatively, the password may be specific such that only a purchaser of a specific BARBIE® doll, such as the WARRIORS doll, is able to use the corresponding WARRIORS avatar in the graphic chatroom  223  (FIG.  9 D). Users that are unable to enter such a password may be limited to using generic avatars (selected from a predetermined list  222 ), or may not even be allowed to enter chatroom  223 , depending on the implementation. Such restriction in the use of organizational avatars to only owners of the corresponding products induces users to purchase the products. Moreover, having a doll on hand in the real world, while using the corresponding avatar on-line provides a child with a novel touch and feel experience that is not available to prior art users of graphic chatrooms. Furthermore, the organization, Mattel can sell to users other products that are displayed in such a chatroom  223 . 
     In variants of the above-described embodiments, an organizational avatar formed by an image that is a trade mark, trade name, service mark or trade dress of an organization is replaced by another organizational avatar that is formed by an image in which the organization has a copyright. One example illustrated in  FIGS. 10A and 10B  uses as avatars  301 A- 301 N corresponding characters Simba, Timon and Pumbaa from the DISNEY movie “The Lion King.” Unless otherwise noted below, acts  312 - 318  illustrated in  FIG. 10B , for use of avatars  301 A- 301 N are similar or identical to the corresponding acts  212 - 218  described above in reference to FIG.  9 B. Although not illustrated in  FIG. 10B , the organization acquires rights to the images (e.g. either from an original author or due to work for hire), prior to act  312 . Here as well, the organization may allow use of the characters free of charge, in the hope that at least one of the users buys (see act  316 ) a product or service related to one of the characters, which product or service is sourced by the organization. Note that the word “sourced” is used to indicate that the organization itself need not sell the product or service, but may license other organizations to perform such sales. 
     Organizational avatars may also be used with Internet-related applications other than chatrooms and websites. For example, a real-time mode of communication such as America Online Instant Messenger may implement organizational avatars if it develops graphics capability. 
     Organizational avatars provide organizations with increased connectivity and interactivity with their customers, thereby providing a cost-effective way of marketing and advertising. For example, whereas employees in McDonalds restaurants only focus on selling the various food items on the menu, a RONALD McDONALD® avatar promotes goodwill (e.g., by playing games and giving out coupons) and collects data from customers (e.g., by using an online suggestion box) in addition to selling the menu items online. Advertising with organizational avatars can be enhanced by the use of banners around the border of the chatroom background, or by the use of tile advertisements as part of the background. Organizational avatars are especially cost-effective in that they reside in the Internet, which is accessible worldwide. Through organizational avatars, companies can interface customers from all over the world. With online activities becoming more prevalent among children and teens, companies that target younger age groups are especially likely to benefit from organizational avatars. 
     Numerous modifications and adaptations of the embodiments and implementations described herein will be apparent to the skilled artisan in view of the disclosure. For example, although in the embodiment described above in reference to  FIG. 10A  characters of avatars  301 A- 301 N are all from the same copyrighted work (DISNEY movie “The Lion King”) characters from different works can be made available in a common chatroom. Examples of other such characters that the same owner Disney could make available include, for example, Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Goofy, Pluto (Mickey&#39;s dog), and Donald Duck. Also, instead of computer  110 , a television can be used in other embodiments. Numerous such modifications and adaptations are encompassed by the attached claims.","1.
