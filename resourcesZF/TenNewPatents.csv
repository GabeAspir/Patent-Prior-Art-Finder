     BACKGROUND 
     The present disclosure generally relates to a mobile device with localized app recommendations, and more specifically to using crowd-sourced app usage data to provide relevant app recommendations to users of mobile devices based on location. 
     Mobile computing devices, such as smart phones, tablet computers, media players, portable computers, and the like, have become ubiquitous. People are ever more reliant on mobile devices for their day-to-day activities. Mobile devices can run software applications, or apps, designed to help users perform specific tasks. Users have a vast set of apps to choose from. For example, there are hundreds of thousands of apps available in the App Store SM . Apps have been downloaded and used by millions. The App Store SM  has provided billions of apps for download. Given the large number of apps available, it can be difficult for users to find the most useful apps. 
     Embodiments of the invention address this and other problems both individually and collectively. 
     BRIEF SUMMARY 
     In some embodiments, mobile devices can provide app recommendations that are relevant to a location of interest. A localized app recommendation can be triggered (e.g., by a mobile device coming within a threshold distance of an application hotspot or some other user action). A location of interest can be determined. The location of interest can be the current location of the mobile device or another location (e.g., the destination in a mapping app). Using the location of interest, a localized application ranking databases with app hotspot and data app ranking/scoring information can be queried with location data representing the location of interest. App recommendations can be received and displayed on the mobile device. For example, icons for apps that are relevant to the location of interest can be visually distinguished from other apps. These and other embodiments of the present invention are described further below.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     Given the vast set of apps that are available, it would be beneficial to provide mechanisms for users to more easily discover apps that are relevant and filter apps that are less relevant. Relevance can be defined with respect to a particular task or goal, or more generally to a given activity. App relevance can be defined as follows: an App Xi is relevant to a given activity Aj if Xi supports conducting activity Aj in a way that makes performing Aj possible, or faster, or easier, or more enjoyable, or it provides in a different way an improved user experience when performing Aj. Therefore, it would be beneficial to enable a user to discover apps that are relevant for the activities that the user needs to perform or is interested in. 
     Often there is a link between spatio-temporal localization and relevance. That is, humans often exhibit a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity. For example, individuals are likely to visit a few highly frequented locations. Individuals may return to highly frequented locations because of the activities that are performed at the locations and/or the tasks being accomplished at the locations. Similarly, the time of day locations are frequented can relate to the activities that are performed at the locations and/or the tasks being accomplished at the locations. For example, restaurants are often frequented at meal times; gyms are visited to work out; offices are for working; libraries are for studying or research; etc. Based on these assumptions, app usage can be related to the activities that can be performed at a given location. Furthermore, by analyzing localized app usage, space-time localization of human activities (some areas may exhibit different popular activities at different times of the day) can be identified. Therefore, some embodiments of the present invention enable the user to find apps that are relevant to specific locations. 
     App usage data, for example uses or downloads of an app, can be tagged with location and/or time information and crowd-sourced from a plurality of mobile devices. A localized app recommendation engine may identify apps that are statistically relevant to particular locations (e.g., locations where the apps have “hotspots” for usage and are more relevant to the particular location than “peer” apps). Various methods, systems, and devices for identifying applications that exhibit localization characteristics (e.g., apps that have “hotspot” locations) are described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/842,724 (Attorney Docket No. 90911-844496), filed concurrently with the present application, the disclosure of which is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. Apps may be manually designated as particularly relevant to certain locations by app developers, application store operators, or the like. 
     Once app hotspots have been identified, app recommendations can be provided to users of mobile devices based on the current location of the mobile device or another specified location. App recommendations can be triggered in a number of ways, and once triggered can be presented to the user in various ways. For example, a user could enter a predetermined radius of an identified hotspot for a particular application and a notification for that application can automatically be displayed on the user&#39;s mobile device. In another example, the user may request apps, overtly or otherwise, that are relevant to a particular location (e.g., apps that are relevant to the final destination specified in a maps app, apps that are relevant to the current location, etc.). 
     In one example, the “Ski Mountain Guide” app may be presented to the user whenever the user is near the ski resort named “Ski Mountain” (e.g., an alert or notification). The American Museum of Natural History app may be presented when the user is in or near the museum. In another example, locally relevant applications may be presented in response to a search (e.g., search for “Paris” returns apps that are locally relevant to Paris). In another example, applications that are locally relevant to a particular area may be grouped together and categorized (e.g., a Paris application category, or more generally, Travel category in the App Store). 
     These and other embodiments will be described further below after example mobile devices and systems are described in the following section. 
     I. Mobile Device and System 
       FIG. 1  shows a high-level block diagram of a mobile device  101 . It will be further appreciated that the device shown in  FIG. 1  is illustrative and that variations and modifications are possible. Mobile device  101  can include a controller  102 , a wireless module  104 , a location module  106 , app recommendation module  108 , a computer-readable medium (CRM)  110 , a display module  112 , and an input module  114 . Mobile device  101  can include additional modules. In some embodiments, mobile device  101  can be a sufficient size, dimension, and weight to enable the device to be easily moved by a user. For example, mobile device  101  can be pocket size. 
     Controller  102 , which can be implemented as one or more integrated circuits, can control and manage the overall operation of mobile device  101 . For example, controller  102  can perform various tasks, such as retrieving various assets that can be stored in CRM  110 , accessing the functionalities of various modules (e.g., interacting with other Bluetooth-enabled devices via Bluetooth module), executing various software programs (e.g., operating systems and applications) residing on CRM  110 , and so on. In some embodiments, controller  102  can include one or more processors (e.g., microprocessors or microcontrollers) configured to execute machine-readable instructions. For example, controller  102  can include a single chip applications processor. Controller  102  can further be connected to CRM  110  in any suitable manner. 
     Wireless module  104  can include any suitable wireless communication technology. For example, wireless module  104  could include a Bluetooth module, a radio frequency (RF) module, a WiFi module, and/or the like. The Bluetooth module can include any suitable combinations of hardware for performing wireless communications with other Bluetooth-enabled devices and allows an RF signal to be exchanged between controller  102  and other Bluetooth-enabled devices. In some embodiments, a Bluetooth module can perform such wireless communications according to Bluetooth Basic Rate/Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and/or Bluetooth Low Energy (LE) standards. The Bluetooth protocol, in general, enables point-to-point wireless communications between multiple devices over short distances (e.g., 30 meters). Bluetooth has gained widespread popularity since its introduction and is currently used in a range of different devices. In order to allow Bluetooth to be used in a greater variety of applications, a low energy variant of the technology was introduced in the Bluetooth Core Specification, Version 4.0. Bluetooth Low Energy (LE), in general, enables devices to wirelessly communicate while drawing low amounts of power. Devices using Bluetooth LE can often operate for more than a year without requiring their batteries to be recharged. 
     For example, a Bluetooth module can include suitable hardware for performing device discovery, connection establishment, and communication based on only Bluetooth LE (e.g., single mode operation). As another example, a Bluetooth module can include suitable hardware for device discovery, connection establishment, and communication based on both Bluetooth BR/EDR and Bluetooth LE (e.g., dual mode operation). As still another example, a Bluetooth module can include suitable hardware for device discovery, connection establishment, and communication based only on Bluetooth BR/EDR. 
     An RF module can include any suitable combinations of hardware for performing wireless communications with wireless voice and/or data networks. For example, an RF module can include an RF transceiver that enables a user of mobile device  101  to place telephone calls over a wireless voice network. 
     A WiFi module can include any suitable combinations of hardware for performing WiFi-based communications with other WiFi-enabled devices. For example, a WiFi module may be compatible with IEEE 802.11a, IEEE 802.11b, IEEE 802.11g and/or IEEE 802.11n. 
     Location module  106  can include any suitable location technology using one or more wireless signals to determine a current location. In some embodiments, location module  106  includes a global positioning system (GPS) module. In some embodiments, location module  106  includes one or more of the following: WiFi location module, cellular location module, crowd-sourced WiFi location module, time of flight calculations (ToF) location module, and the like. 
     App recommendation module  108  can include code that, when executed, determines or provides an app recommendation to the user based on a location. For example, the user can request app recommendations for a particular location. In another example, a notification regarding a locally relevant app could be provided based on the mobile device&#39;s current location. App rec module  108  can also perform device-side collection and aggregation of app usage data for crowd-sourcing. 
     CRM  110  can be implemented, e.g., using disk, flash memory, random access memory (RAM), hybrid types of memory, optical disc drives or any other storage medium that can store program code and/or data. CRM  110  can store software programs that are executable by controller  102 , including operating systems, applications, and related program code (e.g., code for app rec module  108 ). 
     Software programs (also referred to as software or apps herein) can include any program executable by controller  102 . In some embodiments, certain software programs can be installed on mobile device  101  by its manufacturer, while other software programs can be installed by a user. Examples of software programs can include operating systems, navigation or other maps applications, locator applications, productivity applications, video game applications, personal information management applications, applications for playing media assets and/or navigating a media asset database, applications for controlling a telephone interface to place and/or receive calls, and so on. Although not specifically shown, one or more application modules (or set of instructions) may be provided for launching and executing one or more applications, e.g., various software components stored in medium  110  to perform various functions for mobile device  101 . 
     Display module  112  can be implemented using any suitable display technology, including a CRT display, an LCD display (e.g., touch screen), a plasma display, a direct-projection or rear-projection DLP, a microdisplay, and/or the like. In various embodiments, display module  112  can be used to visually display user interfaces, images, and/or the like. 
     Input module  114  can be implemented as a touch screen (e.g., LCD-based touch screen), a voice command system, a keyboard, a computer mouse, a trackball, a wireless remote, a button, and/or the like. Input module  114  can allow a user to provide inputs to invoke the functionality of controller  102 . In some embodiments, input module  114  and display module  112  can be combined or integrated. For example, mobile device  101  can include an LCD-based touch screen that displays images and also captures user input. Illustratively, a user can tap his or her finger on a region of the touch screen&#39;s surface that displays an icon. The touch screen can capture the tap and, in response, start a software program associated with the icon. Upon starting the software program, a graphical user interface for the application can be displayed on the touch screen for presentation to the user. 
       FIG. 2  shows a high-level block diagram of a system  200  for performing certain embodiments of the present invention. The system  200  comprises a plurality of crowd-sourcing mobile devices  210  for providing crowd-sourced app usage data, an app recommendation system  220 , and an app store system  230 . 
     Crowd-sourced location data can be anonymously crowd-sourced from the plurality of mobile devices  210 . Devices may opt-in for this feature. Crowd-sourcing mobile devices  210  can include various hardware and software components, such as illustrated in  FIG. 1 , and/or an app module  212 , location module  214 , and anonymization module  216 . 
     Mobile devices  210  can execute applications with one or more app modules  212 , which can launch and execute various applications. Mobile devices  210  may tag location data to app usage. A location module  214  can determine a current location associated with the app event (e.g., launching the app) and tag the app event with the determined location. In one embodiment, a unique app identifier is assigned to an app. When that app is used, the location data is associated with the app identifier. For example, an application identifier (e.g., app bundle ID) may be associated with the best known current location. Privacy preserving rules (PPR) may be provided and only when privacy preserving rules are met is app usage data collected and submitted. An anonymization module  216  may be provided on the crowd-sourcing mobile devices to decimate data and/or ensure privacy preserving rules are satisfied. In one embodiment, location data for app usage and, optionally, time data may be anonymized on the device-side and submitted to the app recommendation system for further processing. Anonymization may occur on the server-side in addition to, or in lieu of, device-side anonymization. 
     Localized app recommendation system  220  may comprise an app analysis module  222 , device population module  224 , and a localized ranking module  226 . The raw crowd-sourced data from the plurality of mobile devices  210  can be aggregated and the significant usage can be extracted by the recommendation system  220 . Privacy may be preserved and relevant recommendations may be provided by a data processing pipeline that comprises: data decimation; estimation of the spatio or spatio-temporal distribution of usage for individual apps; detecting individual app usage hotspots; and combining the usage information of all the processed apps with metadata (category, user ratings, etc.) in order to generate a relevance-scored list of apps for every space-time bin with significant app usage. The app recommendation system may analyze aggregated data and identify statistical outliers to find apps especially relevant to a particular location. A database of relevance scored apps can be stored in relevance scored apps database  228 . One example of an application that may be highly localized is the Apple Store application because it may be used more frequently at or near Apple retail stores. The app recommendation system may filter out apps that are common across many different locations. For example, a social networking app (such as Facebook) may have very weak localization, and therefore is not relevant to any particular location. Another possible example is the Find My iPhone application because the application is typically used when users cannot find their iPhone, rather than when a user is near a particular location. 
     App store system  230  may provide mechanisms for the user to discover locally relevant apps. App store system  230  can include a database  232  for storing metadata regarding apps available from the app store. App store system  230  can further include a database  234  of app data so that an app can be downloaded by a user. 
     App store system  230  can include an interface (not shown) for communications with a mobile device  240 . This component can include mechanisms for presenting the user with locally relevant apps. Mechanisms for the user to discover locally relevant apps comprise: alerts and notifications, search tools, app categorization, application bundles, etc. In some embodiments, app recommendations are pre-chased to the mobile device, for example, from the localized app recommendation system  220 . Mobile device  240  can include various hardware and software components, such as illustrated in  FIG. 1 , and/or an app tiles database  242 , app recommendation module  108 , and an app store module  244 . 
     App tiles for a predetermined area proximate to a location can be pre-cached to mobile device  240 . Pre-cached app tiles can be stored in app tiles database  242  on mobile device  240 . In this manner, the more specific location recommendations can occur device-side (e.g., on the mobile device, without sending a location to the app store server in order to receive a recommendation). This can further privacy considerations and reduce battery and data consumption. 
     App recommendation module  108  can include code that, when executed, determines or provides an app recommendation to the user based on a location. For example, the user can request app recommendations for a particular location. In another example, a notification regarding a locally relevant app could be provided based on the mobile device&#39;s current location. App recommendation module  108  can interface with the app store module  244 , which can provide a user interface for recommending apps in some embodiments. 
     Now that exemplary devices and systems have been described, we now turn to a high-level description of a method according to an embodiment of the present invention. The devices and systems described above can be used in implementing the following method. 
     II. Overview of Methods 
     One or more of the process blocks of the methods described herein may be optional and may be omitted. The sequence of one or more process blocks may be modified, and the process blocks may be performed in any suitable order. Some of the optional blocks and/or sequence modifications are specifically described herein for purposes of illustration; however, one having skill in the art will recognize that other modifications and omissions are contemplated within the scope of the disclosure. 
       FIG. 3A  shows a flow chart illustrating a method  300  of obtaining locally relevant app recommendations at a mobile device (e.g., mobile device  101  or  240 ). At block  302 , a recommendation is triggered. Triggering of a recommendation may occur in two general ways: (1) in response to a location trigger (e.g., an automatic user notification or alert); or (2) in response to a user input requesting localized apps (e.g., user request). A user trigger could be an overt action requesting local app recommendation or a less overt action by the user (e.g., going to Spotlight or Notification Center on an iOS device). 
     At block  304 , a location for the recommendation is determined. In one embodiment, the location may be the current location of a mobile device (e.g., using GPS or other suitable location technology). In one embodiment, the location can be the last determined location to conserve battery. In one embodiment, the location may be a location other than the current location of a mobile device (e.g., a destination on a map, a location submitted in a search, location specified in a calendar entry, etc.). 
     At block  306 , the app recommendation system is queried for a recommendation based on the location from block  304 . For example, in  FIG. 2 , the app store system  230  may query the localized app recommendation system  220 . In one embodiment, the user requests a list of one or more locally relevant apps. This may occur, for example, using the App Store user interface. An overt user request for a list of locally relevant apps will likely not happen very often, so downloading a list of relevant apps in response to the user request may use only minimal battery power and data bandwidth. 
     In other embodiments, it may be beneficial to notify users asynchronously of locally relevant apps while preserving battery power and reducing data usage. In one embodiment, localized app recommendations may be stored locally on the mobile device. In one embodiment, the locally relevant app recommendations may be asynchronously delivered to the device. In one embodiment, the locally stored relevant app recommendations are associated with a geographic location near and adjacent to the mobile device. Asynchronous delivery of local app recommendation is described in Section V, below. 
     At block  308 , recommendations are presented to the user. The actual ranking may be generated device-side, using the data provided by the recommendation engine. In this way additional pieces of information known to the mobile device can be used for improving the relevance. For instance the language settings on the device, the current date, the origin/destination for routes, current weather, etc. This can be accomplished while still preserving privacy because, in certain embodiments, sensitive data is not sent to a server, rather sensitive data may be used device-side. 
       FIG. 3B  shows a flow chart illustrating a method  350  of determining which apps to present in an app recommendation. This process can be performed by an app recommendation system on a mobile device (e.g., mobile device  101 ,  240 , or the like) or an app recommendation system on a remote server computer (e.g., app recommendation server  220 , app store system  230 , or the like). 
     At block  352 , the app recommendation system receives location data for the location of interest. The location of interest could be the current location of a mobile device or another location of interest. Locally relevant apps for the location of interest can be provided to the extent they exist. 
     At block  354 , the app recommendation system determines a set of apps with hotspots within a threshold distance of the location of interest. The threshold distance may vary from app to app based on a number of factoring including how localized app usage is for that app at the location, the volume of app usage for that app at the location, and other app usage data and app metadata. For example, a first app might be highly localized to a particular building (e.g., an app for a specific museum), while a second app might be localized more generally to a city or neighborhood. The threshold distance for the first app may be less than the threshold distance for the second app. 
     At block  356 , the app recommendation system can rank the apps according to relevance. The relevance ranking can include relevance as to location as well as relevance to other criteria (e.g., user profile, user interests, overall popularity, user reviews, app category, and the like). In some embodiments, the ranking is done using a relevance score. In some embodiments, the ranking is done by ordering/re-ordering the set of apps within hotspots within the threshold distance of the location of interest. 
     In some embodiments, the ranking can be generated device-side, using the data provided by the app recommendation system. In this way additional pieces of information can be used for improving the relevance (e.g., user data, user location history, etc.). For instance the language settings on the device, the current date, the origin/destination for routes, current weather, etc. In some embodiments, this can be incorporated while still preserving privacy, because sensitive data is not sent back to a remote server computer; rather more sensitive information is used inside the mobile device for presenting the user a more relevant ranking. 
     At block  358 , the app recommendation system can select apps to be provided as recommended apps based on the ranking and/or relevance score calculated in the previous step. In some embodiments, a large number of locally relevant apps are returned (e.g., many apps have hotspots and are locally relevant for a particular location), in this instance, the app recommendation system may truncate the list of recommended apps such that only the most relevant apps with local hotspots are selected. For example, the top 5 or top 10 apps for a particular location could be selected. 
     At block  360 , the app recommendation system may provide the app recommendation data. The app recommendation data can include an application identifier, a relevance score, hotspot locations for the app, and other information describing the app or its localized usage properties. The step of providing app recommendation data (block  360 ) can be in response to a query to the app recommendation system (e.g., block  306  in  FIG. 3A ). In some embodiments, if a user accepts a recommendation (e.g., by launching or downloading one of the recommended apps), feedback can be sent back to the app recommendation system. The data may be used for determining the efficacy of the recommendations provided and refining future recommendations. 
     III. User Discovery Mechanisms 
     As described above, app recommendations can be triggered based on the current location of a mobile device, i.e., location-triggered notifications or alerts with app recommendations, and/or user-triggered app recommendations, i.e., triggered by some user action other than the location of the mobile device. Location-triggered notifications or alerts with recommendations are described in more detail in subsection A, below. User-triggered app recommendations are described in subsection B, below. 
     A. Location-Triggered Notifications with Localized Recommendations 
     One of the mechanisms for local app discovery is notifications of relevant apps when the user arrives to an area with highly localized apps. Notifications can be provided for both apps that are already installed on the user&#39;s mobile device (“installed apps”) and apps that are not installed on the user&#39;s mobile device (“uninstalled apps”).  FIG. 4  illustrates a system  400  in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The scale of system  400  shown for illustration purposes only and one having skill in the art will recognize that any suitable scale can be used. For example, hotspots can be relatively small (e.g., building or city block sized) or relatively large (e.g., entire cities, counties, states, etc.) 
     System  400  includes a number of app usage hotspots  440 ,  450 , and  460 , which are hotspots for apps that exhibit a high degree of localization. Hotspot  440  is a hotspot for “Local App A,” hotspot  450  is a hotspot for “Local App B,” and hotspot  460  is a hotspot for “Local App C.” The hotspots can vary in size. As illustrated, hotspot  450  is larger than hotspots  440  and  460 . Hotspot  460  for Local App C is the smallest hotspot illustrated. By way of example, Local App C might be an app designed with the intention that it would be primarily and/or heavily used within a particular store (e.g., the Apple Store app is often used inside of an Apple retail store), whereas Local App B might be an app for discovering “things to do” in Union Square in San Francisco, Calif. 
     A number of users ( 410 - 415 ) are illustrated in various positions within system  400 . Users  410 - 415  can each can have a mobile device (e.g., mobile device  101 ,  240 , etc.) for providing app recommendations in accordance with embodiments of the invention. Only one of the mobile devices ( 420 ) is shown in  FIG. 4 , which corresponds to User  410 &#39;s mobile device. Reference numerals  410 - 415  could also refer to the various positions of a single user at various times. Reference numerals  410 - 415  could also refer to locations of interest of a user other than the current location of the user (e.g., a search input, a map input, etc.). 
     User  410  is positioned within two areas identified as hotspot  440  for Local App A and hotpot  450  for Local App B. User  410  can be associated with mobile device  420 . For example, user  410  could be carrying mobile device  420 . A location module of mobile device  420  can determine the current location of mobile device  420 . An app recommendation module on mobile device  420  (or in operative communication with mobile device  420 ) can determine whether the current location of mobile device  420  corresponds to one or more hotspots for particular apps. In some embodiments, the apps with hotspots may be already installed on mobile device  420 . In some embodiments, the apps with hotspots may not be currently installed on mobile device  420 . In this instance, the current location of mobile device  420  corresponds to hotspot areas for two apps (Local App A and Local App B). 
     In some embodiments, a notification can be provided on a display  421  of mobile device  420 . Display  421  can include a user interface that displays any suitable information. A notification is illustrated on display  421 . For example, the display could include information explaining the reason for the notification and/or relevance of the apps recommended in the notification ( 422 ). In some embodiments, a graphical element (e.g., an icon) corresponding to the identified app can be displayed (e.g.,  423 ,  424 , and the like). In some embodiments, apps identified as locally relevant (i.e., recommended apps) can be downloaded by selecting the graphical element (e.g.,  423  or  424 ). In some embodiments, recommended apps can be launched by selecting the graphical element (e.g.,  423  or  424 ). 
     User  410  is not within a hotspot  460  for Local App C. Therefore, in some embodiments, Local App C may be filtered out of the local app recommendations provided on mobile device  420 . For example, Local App C may receive a low relevance ranking or the like. In some embodiments, user  410  could still receive a notification regarding Local App C on mobile device  420  since it is relatively near user  410 . In some embodiments, the notification for an app such as Local App C may be provided with a lower ranking than more locally relevant apps, such as Local App A and Local App B. 
     User  411  is positioned within an area identified as hotspot  440  for Local App A. In some embodiments, a notification can be provided on a mobile device associated with user  411  with a recommendation for Local App A. Since user  411  is not within a hotspot for Local App B or Local App C, in some embodiments, those apps may be filtered out of the app recommendation and not provided in the notification. In some embodiments, Local App B and/or Local App C could be included in a notification since they are relatively close to the user  411 . In some embodiments, the apps presented in the notification are based on a ranking or relevance score. 
     Users  412  and  413 , like user  411 , can receive a notification for Local App C and Local App B, respectively, since each respective user is located within areas identified as a hotspot for each respective app. In some embodiments, other apps may be filtered out based on the fact that they are not within a hotspot, not within a threshold distance of a hotspot, and/or otherwise have a relevance rank or score below a threshold. 
     User  414  is located in an area that is not associated with any hotspot for any application. In some embodiments, this can mean that no notification is provided to user  414 . In some embodiments, a notification can be provided for apps with hotspots within a threshold distance of user  414 . For example, a notification for Local App B may be provided since Local App B has a hotspot that is the closest to user  414  (as compared to the other illustrated hotspots). 
     Likewise, user  415  is located in an area that is not associated with any hotspot for any application. In some embodiments, this can mean that no notification is provided to user  415 . In some embodiments, a notification can be provided for apps with hotspots within a threshold distance of user  415 . For example, a notification for each of Local App A, Local App B, and Local App C can be provided since user  415  is substantially equidistant from the edges of each of the hotspots  440 ,  450 , and  460 . 
     Notifications can take any suitable form. Although visual notifications on display  421  were described, a notification could include audio, audio-visual, and/or physical forms. For example, an audio (e.g., “ding,” ring tone, or the like) or voice prompt (e.g., SIRI) may notify the user of locally relevant app recommendations. In some embodiments, the prompt may be a vibration alert or an LED alert. One having skill in the art will recognize that other types of notifications are contemplated within the scope of the invention. 
     B. User-Triggered Localized Recommendations 
       FIG. 5  shows a sample mobile device  500  for user-triggered localized recommendations. A user-triggered app recommendation generally refers to triggering an app recommendation, based on a user action, that indicates that the user may be interested in receiving an app recommendation or in other scenarios where a user might find an app recommendation useful. One having skill in the art will realize that mobile device  500  is exemplary in nature and many other embodiments are possible. 
     Mobile device  500  includes a display  510  with a user interface. The user interface can include an option  520  (such as a soft key or other selection mechanism) for the user to overtly request apps that are relevant to a particular location. Responsive to a user actuating the option  520 , mobile device  500  can present locally relevant app recommendation to the user. 
     In some embodiments, the location of interest can be the current location of mobile device  500 . In this instance, mobile device  500  can determine its location responsive to the request for local app recommendations or it can look up a last known location stored on mobile device  500 . Using the location information, a localized app recommendation can be provided. In some embodiments, a particular location can be a location other than the current location of mobile device  520 . 
     In one embodiment, the user deleting an app can trigger an app recommendation. That is, when a user deletes an app, an alternative app may be presented. For example, if the deleted app is a highly localized app for a particular location, another app with high localization to that particular location may be suggested after the user deletes the app. 
     Users can also trigger localized recommendations in a less overt manner. In some embodiments, localized recommendations can be triggered when the user launches an app for downloading new apps (e.g., App Store). In some embodiments, a user search can trigger recommendations for localized apps. These searches can include web searching using engine search, or mobile device searches (e.g., searching the storage of a mobile device using a tool such as Spotlight). In some embodiments, localized recommendations can be triggered when the user accesses a notification area user interface (e.g., Notification Center). In some embodiments, localized recommendations can be triggered when the mobile device is in a screen-saver state or a lock-screen state (e.g., when a mobile device display changes from an off state to a lock-screen state or when a mobile device enters a screen saver state due to user inaction, etc.). 
     Other user actions (or inactions) that may trigger an app recommendation are described further in the following sections. 
     C. User Interface for Presenting Localized Recommendations 
     Once a recommendation has been triggered and localized apps have been identified, the app recommendation can be displayed to a user on a display of a mobile device. There are many options for providing the app recommendation to users so that user can discover locally relevant apps. Some of the mechanisms for app discovery are described in more detail below. 
     In some embodiments, localized apps can be visually distinguished from non-localized apps on a display. For example, visual cues can be presented for apps that are relevant at a location. Visual cues can include highlighting the app icon, animating the icon, adding a sash or badge to the app icon, changing the color/saturation/position/size/opacity of the app icon, or otherwise visually distinguishing locally relevant apps from other apps. 
       FIGS. 6A and 6B  show an example of visually distinguishing localized apps from non-localized apps on a display on a mobile device  600 .  FIG. 6A  shows mobile device  600  with a user interface  610  displaying a number of apps that are available on mobile device  600 . For example, icons for various apps can be provided, including calendar, clock, photos, application store, weather, maps, and settings apps. User interface  610  also includes an SF Guide app icon  620 , a Parking app icon  630 , a Fisherman&#39;s Wharf app icon  640 , and a Paris Guide app icon  650 . In  FIG. 6A , all the app icons are shown in their regular, standard display mode without distinguishing visual characteristics indicating that the app is a localized app or not. This could be because mobile device  600  is in an area where there are not any localized apps or because an app recommendation has not been triggered. 
       FIG. 6B  the same mobile device  600  with a modified user interface  611  after a recommendation has been triggered. User interface  611 , like user interface  610 , displays a number of apps that are available on mobile device  600 . In contrast to user interface  610 , user interface  611  visually distinguishes applications that are locally relevant to a particular location. For example the SF Guide app icon  621 , Parking app icon  631 , and Fisherman&#39;s Wharf app icon  641  are visually distinguished. In the embodiment shown, icons for apps that are not locally relevant are “greyed out.” For example, the icons for Calendar, Clock, Photos, App Store, Settings, and Paris Guide  651  are “greyed out.” In some embodiments, visually distinguished applications can still be launched or downloaded by selecting the application icon, while in other embodiments visually distinguished applications can be prevented from launching or downloaded. 
     For example, mobile device  600  may be located in San Francisco, Calif. when the app recommendation is triggered in  FIG. 6B . Since the device is located in San Francisco, the SF Guide app may be locally relevant and therefore the icon for the app may be highlighted in user interface  611 . Similarly, the Paris Guide app may be visually distinguished since it may not locally relevant to San Francisco. Other apps that exhibit high degrees of local usage may be highlighted, such as Weather, Maps, and Parking apps. For example, it may be that the Weather, Maps, Parking, and Fisherman&#39;s Wharf apps are used more frequently (with statistically significant localized use) in San Francisco by the user than, for example, the Clock app. Therefore, localized apps may be highlighted, while non-localized apps may be de-emphasized. 
     In some embodiments, an interactive visualization tool for local app discovery can be provided. In some embodiments, the interactive visualization tool for local app discovery is provided within an application store, such as the App Store. For example, a map of an area of interest may be displayed. The displayed map can be manipulated by zooming in and zooming out and changing the area of interest. Indications can be provided on the map where localized apps have been identified. In some embodiments, localized app recommendation s may be provided through the interactive visualization tools for local app discovery. For example, based on a relevance ranking, user information, and/or other ranking information a localized app recommendation can be provided. 
     In some embodiments, localized app recommendation can be integrated into other applications running on the mobile device. For example, localized app recommendation can be integrated into map searches, route planning, web browser, calendar events, and the like.  FIGS. 7A and 7B  show two examples of such integration. 
       FIG. 7A  shows an example of integrating app recommendations into a calendar app. Mobile device  700  includes a user interface  710  for a calendar application. User interface  710  can include one or more calendar entries ( 720  and  730 ). The calendar entries can have information associated with the calendar entries that describe the event (e.g., date, time, name, location, and the like). The calendar entries can be displayed in any suitable manner; user interface  710  is one example. Since calendar entries can have a location for the calendar event, localized app recommendations can be provided based on the location. For example, an application recommendation can be triggered and an app recommendation module (or calendar module) can extract calendar information, including an event location from a calendar app. The event location can be used as the location of interest for an app recommendation. 
     For example, in the example illustrated, there is a calendar entry  720  for a ski trip at a particular ski resort location. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the app recommendation module can determine whether there are any applications with usage hotspots at or near the ski location resort location. Other criteria can be applied to filter app recommendations, including the description of the event or activity, user profile information, and the like. In this instance, an application for the ski resort can be recommended to the user from within the calendar app user interface. In some embodiments, an icon  725  for the application can be displayed on the user interface  710 . In some embodiments, actuating the icon  725  causes mobile device  700  to download and/or launch the application associated with icon  725  (here, the “Ski Whistler App”). 
     In another example, there is a calendar entry  730  for a flight to Vancouver. According to some embodiments of the present invention, the app recommendation module can determine whether there are any applications with usage hotspots at or near San Francisco International Airport or Vancouver International Airport. In this instance, an application for the SFO Airport can be recommended to the user from within the calendar app user interface. In some embodiments, an icon  735  for the application can be displayed on the user interface  710  and actuating icon  725  may cause mobile device  700  to download and/or launch the application. 
       FIG. 7B  shows an example of integrating app recommendations into mapping and route planning apps. Locations are often entered or otherwise selected using mapping apps through a user interface  760 . For example, a start point  770  and an end point  780  can be specified. The mapping app can then determine a route  775  from start point  770  to end point  780 . Location information from the mapping application, including location information for the starting point  770 , route  775 , and destination  780 , can be used to provide locally relevant app recommendations to a user. In some embodiments, app recommendations with apps that are locally relevant to the destination can be provided on the user interface  760 . In  FIG. 7B , the destination is the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. In some embodiments, an icon  785  for a locally relevant recommended app can be displayed on the user interface  760  within the maps application. In some embodiments, a visual indicator, such as a sash ( 787 ) or badge, can indicate that the app is locally relevant. In some embodiments, the recommended app can be presented to the user by other notification mechanisms. In some embodiments, actuating the icon  785  causes mobile device  700  to download and/or launch the application (here, the “Musee de Louvre App”). Recommendations could also be provided for locations along the route  775  and/or the starting point of the route  770 . 
     In some embodiments, localized app recommendation can be provided using audio. For example, the user could ask Siri for localized apps relevant to the user&#39;s current location or another location. In some embodiments, Siri can audibly respond by providing localized app recommendations. In some embodiments, Siri can request a user instruction to download and/or launch a localized app that was recommended by Siri. In some embodiments, the user instruction can be provided using voice commands. 
     In one embodiment, an “app suitcase” may be created for a user&#39;s trip. The app suitcase may be a suitcase icon (or a folder icon) on the user interface associated with a city or travel destination. The apps in the suitcase may be apps with a high degree of localization to the travel destination. 
     There are many other possibilities for user interfaces to provide localized app recommendations to users, including recommendations in notifications (e.g., Notification Center, pop-up notifications, banners, email notifications, text message or similar message notifications, and the like), screen savers, lock-screens, and the like. One having skill in the art will recognize that other possibilities exist. 
     IV. Example Use Cases 
     The following are example use cases according to some embodiments of the present invention. 
     Example One 
     A user is attending society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) 2012 Annual Scientific Meeting at Moscone Center in San Francisco, Calif. and has opt-in for localized recommendations using location. After a very long search for parking, he arrives to the Moscone Center, the location for the conference. While waiting in the line for registration, he receives a notification indicating there is a relevant local app for that location and date: “SIR 2012 Annual Scientific Meeting App.” The user installs the app, and now he is able to check up-to-date information about the conference. The user checks what other location app recommendations are provided by the recommendation engine. The user sees that an app called “SFpark” is populated and used frequently at and around his location. Since the user had such a difficult time finding parking before the conference, the user decides to download the SFpark app. A local recommendation for the “Zagat” app is also provided as being locally relevant. The user decides to download Zagat as well to assist in finding a place to eat for lunch. 
     Example Two 
     A user is visiting Fisherman&#39;s wharf during her first trip to San Francisco, Calif. The following is a sample ranking she might see from the recommendation engine: (1) CityGuideDeals—San Francisco for Visitors and Locals; (2) Top 25 San Francisco Attractions Guide; (3) San Francisco Way; (4) San Francisco travel guide—tripwolf; (5) San Francisco Exploration Guide; and (6) San Francisco Guide—mTrip. 
     Example Three 
     A user is visiting the Times Square, Theater District in New York City. The following is a sample app ranking she might see from the recommendation engine: (1) Broadway and Theater—TheaterMania.com; (2) tkts; (3) New York; (4) New York City Essential Guide; (5) New York City Travel Guide—GuidePal; and (6) NYC Way. 
     Example Four 
     A user is planning her trip from New York to Paris. She decides that she will visit the Louvre. She searches maps for finding the route from the hotel she will be staying at. She gets the route and is also presented with an indication (visual cue) that there are locally relevant apps for the destination location. She taps into the corresponding affordance and she is presented with a highly relevant list of Apps for the Louvre. For example, the following is a sample app ranking she might see from the recommendation engine: Musee du Louvre; Monument Tracker PARIS; Paris Tourist Audio Guide; Paris Museums. In some embodiments, the list has been filtered by language (e.g., using the iOS language setting), so only apps in English (or the native language of the user) will show up. The user is also presented with the opportunity to bundle her apps for that trip and pack them into her “App Suitcase” (or other app container, such as a folder) for that trip. In some embodiments, additional discounts can be offered when the locally relevant apps are purchased together. In some embodiments, if the user chooses to buy “App Suitcase” for that trip, the apps will be downloaded while she is still at home (no roaming charges for data), and the apps will be ready to use when she arrives to in Paris. 
     Example Five 
     A user is traveling from Dijon to Paris (3 hours) and will be taking friends who are visiting Paris for the first time to the Louvre. He finds the route from home to the Louvre and he is presented with an indication that there are locally relevant apps for that location. However, he does not have time to buy and/or download the apps right at that moment. He arrives at the Louvre, and there is a very long line (e.g., more than one hour). While waiting in line he receives a notification of relevant local app: Musée du Louvre. He decides to check it out and install the app. Since the line is still moving slowly, he reviews the local app recommendations for Paris with his friends and decides to download additional apps. The following is a sample app ranking he might see from local app recommendation engine: Musee du Louvre; Paris Monument Tracker; Paris, Le Guide du routard; and Musées de Paris. Note the list shows only apps in French, his language setting (compare with example four). 
     Example Six 
     Months later, the same user from Example Five is back in the line for the Louvre with a different group of friends. While waiting in the line he remembers he has the Louvre App; he checks his phone and sees the Louvre App highlighted (or otherwise visually distinguished) because the app is locally relevant for where he is at that moment. 
     Example Seven 
     A user at a retail store wants to check Amazon reviews for a product. Currently if the user has a lot of installed apps that are not organized into folders, it might be difficult to find the right tool for the task at hand. As the number of installed apps grows, so does the time for finding the app the user wants to launch. Using locally relevant apps, the device shows the non-relevant apps greyed-out. This makes it easier to find the locally relevant installed apps for a particular location and time, in this case the Amazon app. 
     Example Eight 
     A user is waiting for a cable car on Powell street in San Francisco. While she waits, she browses locally relevant apps. The Apple Store app is locally relevant (likely because there is a retail store nearby on Stockton Street). The user was unaware that an Apple retail store was close. She downloads the Apple Store app and learns about EasyPay. 
     These examples are provided for illustration only and one having skill in the art will recognize that numerous additional applications of embodiments of the present invention. 
     V. Asynchronous Delivery and Caching of Localized Recommendations 
     In one embodiment, localized app recommendations are delivered to the device using an asynchronous delivery mechanism. The “top” localized apps for the area surrounding the device may be delivered to the device. For example, app tiles containing identifiers for the top localized app and their corresponding hotspots may be pre-cached to the mobile device. The device caches the localized recommendations so that recommendations can be provided without querying a server with the user&#39;s location of interest. Asynchronous delivery and caching of recommendations minimizes battery-power consumption and cellular data usage. According to embodiments of the present invention, top localized apps for particular locations may be packed into manageable file sizes (“app tiles”) for delivery and pre-caching to a device. In some embodiments, more or less information may be downloaded based on the device&#39;s data connection and/or power status. Although localized app recommendations are delivered asynchronously, recommendations are not necessarily provided to the user of the device immediately. Asynchronous delivery and pre-caching may provide the user with faster access to localized app recommendations because the device does not need to contact a server and download the information. 
     An example of an asynchronous delivery mechanism is as follows: A user walks into a Starbucks; therefore, the user might like the Starbucks app. Rather than querying the app store or app recommendation system with the current location of the device, which may occur often, local app recommendations are pre-cached to the device for areas near and adjacent to the location of the device. Pre-caching of local app recommendations for nearby areas provides a more efficient mechanism to deliver the relevant data to the device while minimizing data and battery usage. 
     In one embodiment of an asynchronous delivery mechanism, a server-side app recommendation system may package one or more bins into a binary tile packing format. The domain of interest is divided into a grid (or other partition). In one embodiment of the binary tile packing formatting, each tile may cover a 5 km×5 km square. Each tile may be subdivided into 10 m×10 m bins. The tiles may be divided into any suitable size, including 10 m×10 m bins, 100 m×100 m bins, 1000 m×1000 m bins or 5 km×5 km bins. One having skill in the art will recognize that other granularities may be used depending on the application. 
     For each bin, a list of hyper-local apps for that bin location may be maintained. An example, within each of the 10 m×10 m bins, is a list of top 3 apps that have been identified as super/hyper local. The top hyper-local apps for a particular bin may be maintained based on the hotspot analysis described herein. One having skill in the art will recognize that, while another suitable sized length of hyper-local apps may be maintained, it is beneficial for the asynchronously delivered content to not consume excessive bandwidth. The top hyper-local apps may be refreshed periodically to reflect localized apps that are seasonal in nature or subject to trends. In one embodiment, the top hyper-local apps may be refreshed every 2 or 3 days. One having skill in the art will recognize that other refresh rates are suitable. 
     The one or more binary tiles may be periodically delivered to the device and cached on the device for subsequent use. The number of binary tiles delivered to the device at a given time may vary based on the location of the device, available data connections, and/or power/charging status of the device. 
     Delivery of the binary tile(s) may vary based on the location of the device, available data connections, and/or power/charging status of the device. In one embodiment, if the device is using cellular data, a single tile that is associated with the current location is downloaded. This may reduce cellular data usage and associated expense to the user. In one embodiment, if the device is using WiFi, multiple tiles may be downloaded and cached to the device. For example, the tile associated with the current location and adjacent tiles associated with other nearby areas may be downloaded. This allows more information to be pre-cached while using a potentially faster and less costly data connection. In one embodiment, if the connection speed is faster (whether cellular or WiFi), more tiles are downloaded. In one embodiment, if a device is connected to external power, more tiles may be downloaded and cached to the device. For example, when operating on battery power, the device may download fewer tiles. When plugged into a power source, the device may download more tiles. When running low on battery power, the device may download fewer tiles. 
     Once the data is cached on the device, the device may use the cached localized app recommendations. In one embodiment, when a new location is obtained, the device checks the cached tiles, and specifically a bin associated with the current location, to determine whether there are any localized apps for the current location. In one embodiment, location is periodically obtained and the periodically obtained location is checked against the pre-cached tiles. 
     In one embodiment, a new tile is delivered to the device when there is no pre-cached tile containing a bin associated with the current location of the device. In one embodiment, new tiles are delivered when connected to power. In one embodiment, new tiles are delivered when connected to a WiFi network. 
     The asynchronous delivery of locally relevant content may be applied beyond localized app recommendations. Other types of information may be pre-cached and delivered for fast recall. In one embodiment, WiFi networks may be pre-cached. For example, a table of WiFi MAC addresses with location mapping may be maintained by a server. Tiles of preferred WiFi networks for given bins may be maintained. The tiles of preferred WiFi networks may be delivered to a device asynchronously. Other applications include: locally relevant music content, ads, books, movies, or other media. 
     In some embodiments, a method of asynchronous delivery of locally relevant content to a mobile device comprises: partitioning, by a server, a domain of interest into a plurality bins associated with geographic locations; determining, with the server, locally relevant content recommendations for the plurality of bins using crowd-sourced app usage data; receiving, at the server, a request for locally relevant content recommendations from the mobile device, wherein the request comprises a location; packaging locally relevant content recommendations associated with one or more bins into a file package, wherein the one or more bins are associated with geographic locations near the location; and transmitting, by the server, the file package to the mobile device. In some embodiments, the locally relevant content recommendations include locally relevant app recommendations. In some embodiments, the file package has a file size that is variable, wherein the variable file size is dependent on a power status of the mobile device. In some embodiments, the file package file size is dependent on a network connection of the mobile device. In some embodiments, the file package file size is dependent on the location of the mobile device. 
     VI. Privacy 
     The present disclosure contemplates that privacy is important to users of mobile devices. Therefore, embodiments of the present invention take privacy considerations into account while providing relevant app recommendations. The goals of preserving user privacy and providing accurate, relevant app recommendations to users are aligned. For example, the value of crowd-sourced app usage data here materializes when there is sufficient data from many different users to show meaningful and statistically significant data (eliminating noise). In this context, a lone user&#39;s location and app usage—in isolation—is not helpful. Additionally, in certain embodiments, it is not necessary to have extremely precise location data. Accordingly, embodiments of the present invention contemplate privacy preserving rules. 
     As described above, one aspect of the present technology is the gathering and use of location data available from various sources to recommend apps that may be of interest to users. The present disclosure recognizes that the use of such location data in the present technology can be used to the benefit of users. For example, the location data can be used to better understand user behavior, and facilitate and measure the relevance of applications, advertisements and delivered content. Accordingly, use of such location data enables calculated control of the delivered content. For example, the system can reduce the number of times a user receives a recommendation for a particular application and can thereby select and deliver content that is more meaningful to users. Such changes in system behavior improve the user experience. Further, other uses for location data that benefit the user are also contemplated by the present disclosure. 
     The present disclosure further contemplates that the entities responsible for the collection, analysis, disclosure, transfer, storage, or other use of any location data should implement and consistently use privacy policies and practices that are generally recognized as meeting or exceeding industry or governmental requirements for maintaining location data private and secure. For example, location data should be collected for legitimate and reasonable uses of the entity and not shared or sold outside of those legitimate uses. Further, such collection should occur only after the informed consent of the users. Additionally, such entities would take any needed steps for safeguarding and securing access to such location data and ensuring that others with access to the location data adhere to their privacy and security policies and procedures. Further, such entities can subject themselves to evaluation by third parties to certify their adherence to widely accepted privacy policies and practices. 
     Despite the foregoing, the present disclosure also contemplates embodiments in which users selectively block the use of, or access to, location data. That is, the present disclosure contemplates that hardware and/or software elements can be provided to prevent or block access to such location data. For example, in the case of application recommendation services, the present technology can be configured to allow users to select to “opt in” or “opt out” of participation in the collection of location data during registration for services. In another example, users can select not to provide location information for application recommendation services. For example, devices of users that opt-in for localized app recommendation features will tag location data to app usage when privacy preserving rules (PPR) are met. Device-side, the localized App usage data may be anonymized and submitted to the app recommendation system for further processing. In another example, app developers may be provided with the capability to “opt in” or “opt out” of localized recommendations for particular apps that they develop. In yet another example, users can configure their devices or user terminals to prevent storage or use of cookies and other mechanisms from which location data can be discerned. The present disclosure also contemplates that other methods or technologies may exist for blocking access to their location data. 
     Therefore, although the present disclosure broadly covers use of location data to implement one or more various disclosed embodiments, the present disclosure also contemplates that the various embodiments can also be implemented without the need for accessing such location data. That is, the various embodiments of the present technology are not rendered inoperable due to the lack of all or a portion of such location data. For example, content can be selected and delivered to users by inferring preferences based on non-personal information data or a bare minimum amount of personal information, such as the content being requested by the device associated with a user, other non-personal information available to the content delivery services, or publically available information. 
     VII. Exemplary Server and Mobile Device Architecture 
     It should be understood that the present invention as described above can be implemented in the form of control logic using computer software in a modular or integrated manner. Based on the disclosure and teachings provided herein, a person of ordinary skill in the art will know and appreciate other ways and/or methods to implement the present invention using hardware and a combination of hardware and software. The various participants and elements described may operate or use one or more computer apparatuses to facilitate the functions described herein. Examples of such subsystems or components are shown in  FIG. 8 , which may illustrate parts of a computer apparatus. 
     The subsystems shown in  FIG. 8  are interconnected via a system bus  875 .

US-6786308-B1,"An anti-lock brake system for a bicycle having sliding assembly (having a brake shoe therein) and a plurality of springs defined in a brake shoe holder in turn, a bottom of the brake shoe holder and a connecting side of the sliding assembly are correspondingly in gradient formed and both of them to be abutted against each other and they are slanted formed outwardly in accordance with the direction of the rotation of the tire of the bicycle. The sliding assembly further includes a plurality of recesses formed therein for receiving sliding members, an abrasion-resistant member disposed at the bottom of the recess of the brake shoe holder.","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     1. Field of the Invention 
     The present invention relates to a brake device, and more particularly to an anti-lock brake system for a bicycle. 
     2. Description of the Prior Arts 
     A conventional brake device for a bicycle generally includes a pair of brake shoes and a brake arm, the brake shoes are coupled to both legs of the brake arm and then the brake arm is mounted to the rear and/or front fork of a bicycle with the brake shoes standing oppositely at both sides of the wheel rim of the bicycle. The brake shoes are employed to press against the wheel rim from both sides by virtue of the brake arm and a friction to be generated to stop the rotation of the tires. This kind of brake device has been commonly used in nowadays, however, there are still some shortcomings need to be improved: 
     In event of an emergency brake, the braking force is greater than the friction force of the tires due to a great force applied by the rider to press on the hand brake in order to stop the rotation of the tires, which will generate a dead lock of the tire in a sudden and result in a skidding and overturning of the bicycle and hurt of the rider. 
     A buffering device targeting at the solution of the above problem is shown in FIG. 1 including: a brake shoe holder  10 , the brake shoe holder  10  to be mounted to a brake arm by virtue of a connecting rod  11  coupled at a side opposite to the wheel rim of the tire and has a pair of protruding edges opposite to each other defining a space for accommodating a sliding piece  17  therein, furthermore, the brake shoe holder  10  defining a threaded hole  12  at a first end for engaging a bolt  13  and a recess  14  at a second end for accommodating an elastic member  15 , a brake shoe  16  to be engaged in the sliding piece  17  and the sliding piece  17  has a first end connected to the elastic member  15  and a slot  18  defined at a second end engaging with the bolt  13  for preventing the sliding piece  17  from sliding out from the brake shoe holder  10 , in such a manner, taking use of the slide of the sliding piece  17  in the space of the brake shoe holder  10  and the elastic member  15  to buffer a friction of the brake shoe  16  while it pressing against the wheel rim the tire. Although this braking device has been commonly used, there are also some shortcomings need to be improved: 
     First, this braking device is too complicated that the brake shoe holder  10  not only needs a pair of protruding opposite edges to define a space for the receiving and slide of the brake shoe  16  therein but also the brake shoe  16  should be engaged in the a sliding piece  17  having a slot  18  for engaging a bolt  13 , in this case, it&#39;s not only complicated in assembling process but the production cost is increased as well. 
     Second, there is only a very short distance (about a 1 mm in distance) for the slide of the brake shoe  16  in the brake shoe holder  10  according to this device, which is not long enough for buffering the friction generated from the braking motion and accordingly a rider is not able to control the bicycle effectively. 
     Third, in accordance with the brake device for a bicycle, the brake shoe only has a very short contracting distance while a braking motion being operated and it will be contracted to an end thereof and will not return to the original position till the rider release the handle brake, thereby, there will be a great friction caused from a part of the tire and the ground and do a great harm to the tire. 
     Fourth, in accordance with this conventional brake device for a bicycle, the brake shoe holder  10 , the recess  14 , the brake shoe  16  and the sliding piece  17  all move in a straight line, however, the tires of the bicycle do rotational movement, in such a manner, a stress of the tire is generated from the friction of the brake shoe  16  while a braking motion being operated which can&#39;t be transmitted completely to the elastic member  15  and a part of it can&#39;t be counteracted (which is perpendicular to a direction of the movement of the brake shoe  16 ), as a result, the brake shoes  16  is not allowed to move smoothly and freely in the space of the brake shoe holder  10  and great frictions and collisions will be caused in the related parts. 
     The present invention has arisen to mitigate and/or obviate the afore-described disadvantages of the conventional anti-lock brake system for a bicycle. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     In accordance with one aspect of the present invention, there is provided an anti-lock brake system for a bicycle having sliding assembly (having a brake shoe therein) and a plurality of springs defined in a brake shoe holder in turn, an acting direction and location of the springs are corresponding to that stress direction of the brake shoe, the brake shoe is partially engaged in the brake shoe holder, a bottom of the brake shoe holder and a connecting side of the sliding assembly is correspondingly in gradient formed and both of them to be abutted against each other and slantingly formed outwardly in accordance with the direction of the rotation of the tires of the bicycle. (For an alternative that a plurality of sliding members also can be defined between the bottom of the brake shoe holder and the sliding assembly and in addition, an abrasion-resistant member can be defined at the bottom of the recess of the brake shoe holder). In such a manner, which not only can buffer a braking friction generated from an emergency brake but also prevent a great friction from being caused in the related parts of the braking device. 
     The primary objective of the present invention is to provide an improved anti-lock brake system for a bicycle, which is not only capable of buffering a braking friction from being generated from an emergency brake but also preventing a great friction caused in the related parts of the braking device. 
     Another objective of the present invention is to provide a simple anti-lock brake system for a bicycle, which is not only reduce the production cost to the least but also simplify the assembling process. 
     A further objective of the prevent invention is to provide an improved anti-lock brake system for a bicycle allowing a free and smooth slide of the sliding assembly in the brake shoe holder and the quick return of the brake shoe to the original position so as to provide a smooth braking operation. 
     The present invention will become more obvious from the following description when taken in connection with the accompanying drawings, which shows, for purpose of illustrations only, the preferred embodiments in accordance with the present invention.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
     Referring to the FIGS. 2-4, in which, an anti-lock brake system in accordance with one aspect of the present invention comprises a brake shoe holder  20 , a sliding assembly  30 , a brake shoe  40  and two springs  50 . The brake shoe holder  20  has a shape of curved recess  21  and an opening  24  defined at a side facing to a wheel rim  60  and has bolt  22  located at a bottom thereof which is respectively to be coupled to both ends of a brake arm  61  by virtue of the bolt  22  and screw nuts  23 . 
     Both sides of the opening  24  are curvely formed with edges  25 , a slope  26  is formed at the bottom of the recess  21  in a manner that the slope  26  slants outward in a forward rotating direction of the tire, two protrusions  27  are formed at a side corresponding to the slope  26 . The brake shoe holder  20  is curvely formed in an arc A corresponding to a rotary angel of the wheel rim  60 . 
     The sliding assembly  30  is received in the recess  21  of the brake shoe holder  20  and confined in the opening  24  by the curved edge  25 . The brake shoe  40  is partially accommodated in sliding assembly  30  and partially protruding the opening  24  of the brake shoe holder  20  therefrom (corresponding to the both sides of the wheel rim  60  of the bicycle). A pair of protrusions  31  are formed at a side of the sliding assembly  30  corresponding to that protrusions  27  of the brake shoe holder  20 . The sliding assembly  30  also has a slope  32  formed at the bottom of the sliding assembly in a manner that the slope  32  slants outward in the forward rotating direction of the tire corresponding to the slope  26  of the brake shoe holder  20 . The spring  50  is accommodated in the recess  21  of the brake shoe holder  20  having a first end engaged with the protrusions  27  and a second end engaged with the protrusions  31  of the sliding assembly  30 . 
     Referring further to the FIGS. 5-8, which shows the first embodiment of the present invention. In the FIG. 5 shows the status of the anti-lock brake system of the present invention before a braking action being operated, in which, the brake shoe holders  20  at both ends of the brake arm  61  are apart from the wheel rim  60  of the bicycle by virtue of the brake arm  61 , the sliding members  30  are pushed to one end of the recesses  21  of the brake shoe holders  20  by the springs  50  and further by the cooperation of the slope  32  of the sliding assembly  30  and the slope  26  of the brake shoe holder  20  abutting against each other, thereby the wheel rim  60  of the bicycle is not in the braking status (is not being pressed by the brake shoes  40 ). 
     Referring the FIG. 6, which shows the very beginning status of a braking action just be operated, when a rider press the hand brake, the brake arm  61  will enforce the two brake shoe holders  20  to press against the wheel rim  60  of the bicycle and the part of the brake shoe  40  protruding from the opening  24  of the brake shoe holder  20  begin to rub the wheel rim  60  of the bicycle, right this moment, a great inertial stress will be transmitted to the brake shoes  40  from the wheel rim  60  of the bicycle, accordingly it will be further transmitted to the slopes  32  and the springs  50  by the brake shoes  40  and the sliding assembly  30 , due to the inertial force of the bicycle is minor than the elastic force of the springs  50 , the sliding assembly  30  stay motionlessly in the brake shoe holders  20 , and thereby the bicycle in a low speed can be stopped. 
     Referring to the FIG. 7, which shows a continuous braking action (an emergency brake) of an anti-lock brake system for a bicycle is being operated, in this status, both a force the rider pressed on the hand brake and the inertial force of the bicycle are very great, and the inertial force of the bicycle is greater than the elastic force of the springs  50 , so the sliding assembly  30  begin to push and compress the springs  50 , accordingly the sliding assembly  30  slide relatively in the recess  21  of the brake shoe holder  20  and slide slantingly outward by a cooperation of the slope  32  of the sliding assembly  30  and the slope  26  of the brake shoe holder  20  abutting against each other and the brake shoes  40  slide slantingly outward too, in such a manner, a stress generated form the braking action can be absorbed by the slope  26  and the springs  50  without difficulties by virtue of the arc A of the brake shoe holders  20 , the sliding members  30  and the brake shoes  40 , thereby the friction force of the brake shoes will be reduced and the braking force will not be greater than the friction of the tire of the bicycle (no dead lock of tire&#39;s rotation happened), furthermore, the wheel rim  60  can be a bit rotate forward and no overly great friction force between the tires and the ground caused and the rider will not lose steering. 
     Referring the FIG. 8, which shows a secondary circle of the braking action, due to the slant slide of the brake shoes  40 , the friction force is reduced, the springs  50  begin to release the restoring force pushing the sliding assembly  30  to return slantingly inward by the cooperation of the slope  26 , 32 , which increase the friction force of the brake shoes  40  acting on the wheel rim  60 , such an action of the sliding members  30  will be repeatedly so as to achieve an effect of an anti-lock brake system and an emergency brake of he bicycle can be smoothly eased off by the release and compress of the brake alternatively happened in a twinkling, in this manner the rider will not lose steering control of the bicycle and no overly friction caused in the related parts. 
     Furthermore, the braking distance of the tire is based on the elastic force of the springs, the inclination of the slope and the inertia force, so which can be adjusted by the manufacturers as deferent requirements of the riders. 
     It is to be noted that the brake shoe holders  20  are permitted to be whole-set replaced, which is easy for assembling and dismantling and the structure is simple (reduce the production cost). 
     Referring again to the FIG. 2, a plurality of draining holes  70  can be defined in a side of the brake shoe holder  20  which allowing for the drainage of the mud or greasy dirt therefrom and allow the rider inject grease or clean the inside therethrough. 
     An anti-lock brake system for a bicycle in accordance with the first embodiment of the present invention is described as above. 
     In accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention there is provided another anti-lock brake system for a bicycle as shown in FIGS. 9-11 which structural arrangement is basically identical with that of the first embodiment, the only difference is: a plurality of sliding members  80  and an abrasion-resistant member  90  are added, furthermore, the sliding assembly  30  is provided with a plurality of cavities  33 . 
     The sliding members  80  may be metal balls, rollers, needle rollers or the like, slidably received in the respective cavities  33  of the sliding assembly  30 , which will be rolling in the event that the sliding assembly  30  is sliding so as to provide a smooth slide of the sliding assembly  30  in the recess  21  of the brake shoe holder  20 . 
     The abrasion-resistant member  90 , corresponding to the slope  26  at the bottom of the recess  21  of the brake shoe holder  20 , is made from abrasion-resistant material, which correspondingly providing a rolling friction to the sliding members  80 . 
     Due to the working principles of the two anti-brake lock systems in according with the first and second embodiment of the present invention are identical, further remarks on this matter will seem superfluous. 
     While we have shown and described various embodiments in accordance with the present invention, it should be clear to those skilled in the art that further embodiment may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention.","What is claimed is:

US-5913778-A,"A basketball mounting system for an in-ground basketball system has a flanged basketball support pole and a flanged ground sleeve receiving a portion of the pole in overlapping relationship. The flanges are connected together by removable fasteners such as threaded bolts. In addition, the mounting system may include jacking members in the pole flange to facilitate removal of the pole from the ground sleeve. The jacking members include members such as threaded bolts passing through the pole flange that, when rotated in one direction, press against the ground sleeve flange causing the pole and the ground sleeve to separate.","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     1. Field of the Invention 
     The invention relates generally to a mounting system for an in-ground basketball system and, more particularly, to a flanged ground sleeve that receives in overlapping relationship an end of a flanged pole, and which may incorporate a mechanical device to facilitate removal of the pole from the ground sleeve. 
     2. Related Art 
     In-ground basketball systems are usually permanently mounted in the ground adjacent a playing surface, such as a driveway. Traditionally, a basketball system includes a pole supporting a backboard and a goal. To rigidly support the basketball system in a upright position, in the past, a hole was formed in the ground, filled with concrete and one end of the pole, was sunk directly in the concrete and the concrete was allowed to set. Then, the backboard and goal would be assembled on the top end of the pole. Once the concrete has set, the pole is essentially permanently mounted and, effectively, cannot be removed short of digging up the ground and breaking the concrete slug off of the end of the pole. 
     However, it may be desirable or necessary to remove the pole from the ground after installation for purposes of maintenance, convenience, storage, relocation and/or security. Removability is particularly important for heavy duty and/or high performance basketball systems because consumers are more likely to want to move these more expensive systems. 
     One approach that has been used to provide basketball pole removability is known as an anchor bolt style footing. In one such known footing, the anchor includes a stem with a flat square plate including bolt openings disposed on one end of the stem. The stem is set in the concrete so that the flat plate provides a flat mounting surface for a pole of the type having a square flat plate at its lowermost end. The pole flat plate has bolt openings alignable with the bolt openings in the anchor. The pole plate is aligned on the anchor plate; and nuts and bolts are used to secure the two flat plates together. This manner of mounting a basketball pole, however, is difficult because it: is susceptible to tipping over if the bolts break or the nuts are loosened/removed; and is difficult, if not impossible, to remove the pole once the bolts, nuts and flange seize over time due to corrosion and exposure to the elements. 
     Another approach that has been used to removably mount an in-ground basketball system is through the use of a ground sleeve. A ground sleeve is generally an elongated tubular member having an open end and a closed end, which is often in the form of a cap or cover. During installation, the ground sleeve is positioned in the fresh concrete with the open end exposed to receive the end of a conventional basketball pole that would otherwise have been sunk directly in the concrete. The pole is received in the open end of the ground sleeve. The size of the ground sleeve is usually somewhat larger than the size of the pole to accommodate manufacturing tolerances and variations in size, and to facilitate assembly on location. Accordingly, once the pole is disposed in the ground sleeve, it is loose and the pole must be secured fixedly in the ground sleeve so that the pole will not tilt or rotate. 
     In one known ground sleeve, a locking tab is used to secure the pole and ground sleeve together. The locking tab is inserted in the gap between the pole and the ground sleeve and a bolt is threaded through the tab perpendicular to the tab and the pole. When the bolt is tightened, the end of the bolt presses against the side of the pole causing the pole to be tightened in the ground sleeve. However, the gap between the pole and the ground sleeve remains open at the open end of the ground sleeve allowing rain and debris to enter and collect between the inside of the ground sleeve and the pole. Over time, this exposure to the weather may cause the pole and ground sleeve to corrode and seize making pole removal difficult if not impossible. 
     A better way of securing a ground sleeve and pole together is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,229 to Fitzsimmons et al., assigned to the assignee of this application. Fitzsimmons et al. &#39;229 discloses a ground sleeve having a deformable end that is secured to the pole by screwing a cap on the deformable end of the ground sleeve to form a collet having an adjustable opening for engaging the pole. The ground sleeve and cap are formed of a corrosion resistant material and the cap helps protect the ground sleeve and the end of the pole from the elements, thereby facilitating removal of the pole even after a long passage of time. 
     Another known ground sleeve mounting system includes a flat square flange plate covering its open end to form a flat mounting surface. The basketball pole has another flat square flange plate covering its outermost end. The flanges are approximately 12 inches by 12 inches. During installation, the pole plate is disposed on the ground sleeve plate and the plates are clamped together by nuts and bolts. This construction is susceptible to tipping over during installation, or if the bolts break or the nuts are loosened/removed. Moreover, due to exposure to the elements, the bolts, nuts and flanges may corrode and attach together making removal of the pole difficult if not impossible. 
     Mounting systems for supporting a pole in the ground in non-basketball environments often are overly complicated or cumbersome, are not designed to facilitate removal, and often require the use of an intermediate sleeve. One type of pole stand is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,989 to Apple. The Apple &#39;989 patent discloses a cylindrical two-piece pole stand assembly where two internal pivots arms are engaged upon insertion of the pole to lock the two pieces together. In particular, a tubular insert is disposed in a ground sleeve until a collar on the tubular insert comes to rest on a collar on the ground sleeve. The insertion of a pole (not shown) into the tubular insert causes pivot arms on the interior of tubular insert to engage the collar on ground sleeve, thereby locking the tubular insert and ground sleeve together. This device requires not only the use of a tubular sleeve in addition to the pole, but also requires the pole to lock the tubular sleeve to the ground sleeve. Although not shown, the pole would finally come to rest on the bottom of the ground sleeve. Moreover, the ground sleeve has a drainage hole which exposes the interior of the sleeve and the pole to the elements. 
     In U.S. Pat. No. 3,612,287 to Maltese, a tubular upright support member for floor display fixtures is inserted into a tapered floor plug through the use of a tapered tubular adapter. To vary the height of the support member, a locknut is variably positioned on a threaded end of the support member. Then, the threaded end of the support member is threaded into the adapter, and the tapered end of the adapter is wedged into the floor plug. The support member and the adapter are not otherwise secured into the floor plug. Similar, to Apple &#39;989, the Maltese &#39;287 pole mounting system requires the use of an intermediate member to mount the pole. Moreover, because the adapter frictionally engages the floor plug, removal is difficult, especially if other shaped members are used such as square. 
     The foregoing discussion shows there is a need for an improved ground sleeve for basketball systems that is capable of supporting even the most heavy duty of in-ground basketball systems in a substantially upright rigid and stable position without the risk of tipping, yet also can be readily removed even if the pole and the ground sleeve have seized due to exposure to the elements and/or corrosion. Moreover, a simple interconnection between the pole and ground that eliminates the need for intermediate connecting members also is needed. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The invention meets these needs and avoids the drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art by providing a mounting system for supporting an in-ground basketball system including a flanged ground sleeve used in combination with a flanged pole in which a portion of the basketball support pole and the ground sleeve overlap to prevent the pole from tipping over when unsecured. 
     In one particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, this is accomplished by having the pole flange, which is disposed intermediate but near one of the pole ends, and the ground sleeve flange each extend outwardly from the longitudinal axis of the support system. One end of the pole is received within the open end of the ground sleeve until the flanges come into contact and the pole cannot be inserted any further, thereby creating an overlap between the pole and ground sleeve. Removable connectors couple the ground sleeve flange and the pole flange together outside of the basketball pole. The connectors may be in the form of weld nuts and bolts associated with the pole and ground sleeve flanges. In practice, an overlap between the pole and ground sleeve on the order of about five inches is sufficient to hold the system in place without having to rely upon the function of any of the bolts. 
     In another embodiment of the invention, the pole flange may have a portion that is curved or tapered relative to the longitudinal axis of the basketball support pole. This feature improves the strength of the flange. In addition, the ground sleeve flange may be formed to have a shape corresponding to the ground sleeve flange to assist with positioning and alignment of the pole flange and the pole in the ground sleeve. 
     According to another aspect of the invention, the in-ground basketball support system may include one or more jacking members forming a release system facilitating the removal of the pole from the ground sleeve. The jacking member may be in the form of a bolt threaded through only one of the flanges, preferably the pole flange. In one embodiment, two jacking members are disposed on opposing sides of the pole. In operation, any mechanical connectors used to connect the pole to the ground sleeve during installation are removed. Then, the jacking bolt is rotated in one direction until the pole and the ground sleeve separate so that the pole can be removed entirely from the ground sleeve. 
     The overlapping pole and ground sleeve design of the invention in conjunction with the flanged connection provides a stronger interface with less flange area required than typically was the case in prior ground sleeve support systems. The overlapping design is an inherent safety feature that eliminates or significantly reduces the likelihood of a system falling over and causing damage, especially during installation, maintenance or pole removal. The release system of the invention provides a mechanical assist for separating the pole that heretofore has not been commercially available in prior basketball support systems. 
     Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
     Referring to FIG. 1, an in-ground basketball system of the invention is shown generally at 10. In-ground basketball system 10 generally includes a ground sleeve 12, a basketball support pole 18, a backboard 20 and a goal 24. In particular, ground sleeve 12 is substantially encased in concrete 14 filled in a hole in ground 16. Pole 18 has a bottom end 28 removably secured, in accordance with the invention, in ground sleeve 12 and a top end 30 supporting backboard 20 by way of support arms 22. Goal 24 is mounted on a front face of backboard 20 supported on pole 18 in a conventional manner. As shown, goal 24 has a net 26 hanging therefrom. 
     Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, an enlarged overview of a basketball pole mounting system constructed in accordance with the principles of the invention will be discussed. Pole 18 is removably secured in ground sleeve 12 along a longitudinal axis 17 of the support system in a manner discussed below such that longitudinal axis is substantially upright. Generally, pole 18 has a peripheral flange 32 extending outwardly from pole 18 intermediate bottom end 28 and top end 30. It is preferred that flange 32 be much closer to bottom end 28 than top end 30. Ground sleeve 12 has a peripheral flange 34 extending outwardly from an open end 63 of ground sleeve 12 (shown best in FIG. 10). Bottom end 28 of pole 18 is received within ground sleeve 12 in overlapping relationship and flanges 32, 34 are connected to secure pole 18 and ground sleeve 12 together. 
     Ground sleeve 12 is disposed in concrete such that flange 34 is disposed above top surface 13 of concrete 14 as shown in FIG. 3, with a spacing of approximately 1 inch above the top surface being preferred. However, flange 34 need only be disposed slightly above top surface 13 of concrete 14 so long as concrete 14 does not interfere with the mechanical connection of flange 32 to flange 34. For example, it is desirable that concrete 14 does not contact weld nuts 78b, 80b, 82b and 84b provided on lower surface 76 of ground sleeve flange 34, which are described subsequently. Upon installation of pole 18 into ground sleeve 12, bottom end 28 is received in the ground sleeve 12 until flange 32 contacts flange 34. Then, flange 32 is secured to flange 34 as described in detail in the following discussion. 
     The details of one embodiment of basketball support pole 18 will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. 5-7. Pole 18 preferably is a hollow elongated member having a thin peripheral wall 37 formed by four sides 38, 40, 42 and 44 interconnected by four generally rounded comers. Wall 37 preferably is formed from a rigid material such as metal, for example, 11 gauge steel with a thickness of approximately 0.12 inches. In transverse cross-section, pole 18 has a generally square shape with a 4 inch exterior length and a 4 inch exterior width. Pole 18 has a length of a standard in-ground basketball pole, for example, approximately 141.25 inches in total length. Pole 18 may include pole sections, in particular, two 54 inch pole sections and one 34.625 inch pole section; or, for purposes of compact shipping, may include three substantially equal length pole sections each having a 47 inch length. Bottom end 28 and top end 30 of pole 18 preferably are open as illustrated in the top and bottom views of pole 18 shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Top end 30 may be closed by a pole cap 31 as shown in FIG. 1. Other pole shapes, sizes and constructions may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention as will be recognized by the skilled artisan. 
     Pole flange 32 may be formed from a flat annular ring having an upper surface 56 and lower surface 58 with a central opening therein and through which pole 18 is disposed. Flange 32 is fixedly secured to the outer periphery of pole 18 by welding, for example. Preferably, the weld is made on an upper surface 56 of flange 32 as illustrated in FIG. 7 at 57, so as to not interfere with the interface between flange 32 and flange 34. Flange 32 extends outwardly from pole 18 in a direction substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis 19 of pole 18, although other orientations may be employed. Flange 32 is disposed on pole 18 preferably about 5.25 inches inwardly from the outermost portion 47 of bottom end 28 so as to define approximately a 5.25 inch pole section 46 that is received in overlapping relationship with ground sleeve 12 for purposes discussed in detail later. The exact placement of flange 32 along pole 18 and thereby the length of the pole overlap section 46 may vary so long as the length received within ground sleeve 12 is sufficiently long to prevent pole 18 from tipping over, and to adequately limit vibration and movement of pole 18 during play. 
     An outer periphery of pole flange 32 defines a substantially square shape with rounded comers corresponding to the square shape of pole 18. If the outer length and width of flange 32 is approximately 7 inches, flange 32 extends a distance of approximately 1.5 inches outwardly from the outer peripheral wall 37 of a 4 inch square pole 18. The thickness of the flange 32 between upper and lower surfaces 56, 58 may be preferably approximately 0.38 inches. Because the invention includes pole overlap section 46, the size of flange 32 may be reduced without sacrificing stability as discussed in greater detail later. However, the precise size, shape and thickness of flange 32 may be varied so long as the flange is sufficiently strong to bear the load of basketball system 10 without causing flanges 32 and 34 to fail, such as by bending, during steady state installation, play, inclement weather and removal. For example, when larger backboards are used or when ground sleeve 12 and pole 18 must support an unusually large amount of weight, then flanges 32 and 34 may be enlarged in size and/or thickness in a manner readily apparent to the skilled artisan. 
     Pole flange 32 is adapted to be connected to flange 34 of ground sleeve 12. In particular, as shown in FIGS. 5-6, each of the four corners of flange 32 has a clearance hole 48, 50, 52 and 54 passing there through, preferably 0.5 in diameter. As discussed in detail later, a threaded bolt 60 (FIG. 12) is passed through each of clearance holes 48, 50, 52 and 54, respectively, and then into corresponding clearance holes (discussed with reference to FIGS. 8-10) provided in flange 34 of ground sleeve 12. Nuts may be welded to the under side of ground sleeve flange 34 to receive the bolt 60 for fixedly, but removably securing pole 18 in ground sleeve 12. The size of clearance openings 48, 50, 52 and 54 may be varied from 0.5 inches so long as they are of a size sufficient to receive a bolt that is strong enough to withstand shearing and failure under the load of basketball system 10. In the alternative, the grade of bolt 60 may be increased. In accordance with this particular embodiment of the invention, a grade no. 2 bolt is used. 
     Referring now to FIGS. 8-10, the details of one embodiment of ground sleeve 12 will be discussed. Ground sleeve 12 includes a main body 66 having an open end 63 and an opposed, closed end 64 for receiving a bottom portion of pole 18. Similar to pole flange 32, ground sleeve flange 34 is in the form of a flat annular ring having upper and lower surfaces 74, 76 with a central opening through which open end 63 of main body 66 is disposed. Flange 34 is fixedly secured to main body 66 adjacent open end 63 by, for example, welding. Preferably, the weld is provided on lower surface 76 of flange 34 such that the weld does not interfere with the interface between flanges 32 and 34. 
     Flange 34 extends outwardly from main body 66 in a manner substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis 19a of ground sleeve 34, which should be coincident with longitudinal axis 19 of pole 18 to define a longitudinal axis 17 of the mounting system when installed within ground sleeve 12. Main body 66 is a hollow member formed by a wall 62 of a rigid material such as metal, for example, 11 gauge steel, having a thickness of approximately 0.12 inches and length of approximately 17 inches. These dimensions offer adequate stability and anchoring for the basketball system 10, however, ground sleeve 12 may be formed of other thicknesses or lengths depending upon the particular design employed. Main body 66 has a substantially square transverse cross-sectional shape to match the shape of pole 18, but other shapes for both the ground sleeve and pole may be employed as will be recognized by the skilled artisan. 
     Closed end 64 at the lower end of ground sleeve 12 is disposed in concrete 14 and open end 63 at the upper end of ground sleeve 12 receives pole 18. Main body 66, as shown, is integrally formed with closed end 64, however, in the alternative, the lower end may be formed with an open end closed by a cap. The configuration of ground sleeve 12 varies along its longitudinal axis 19a. In particular, main body 66 has a first portion 68 that has an expanded size in transverse cross-section and a second portion 70, which is slightly narrower in transverse cross-section than first portion 68. First portion 68 is configured to receive pole overlap section 46 therein. A small shoulder or ledge 72 is formed between the first and second portions 68, 70. First portion 68 has a shape corresponding to the shape of pole 18 and interior dimensions slightly larger than the exterior dimensions of pole overlap 46 of pole 18. For example, first portion 68 may have an interior transverse cross-sectional length and width of about 4.030×4.030 inches and a longitudinal length ofjust over about 5.25 inches. This interior size should provide for a loose fit or a slip fit between the exterior surface of pole 18 and the interior surface of first portion 68 of ground sleeve 12. Preferably, this fit is not an interference fit to facilitate removability. First portion 68 may be formed with a larger interior dimension. However, enlarging the transverse size of the interior of first portion 68, and thereby creating a significant gap between pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, may sacrifice stability of the support system and possibly introduce vibration and movement into the system. First portion 68 may also include a tapered portion 82 at open end 63 that is slightly larger than first portion 68 and which tapers inwardly to the size of first portion 68. This tapered portion 82 facilitates insertion of bottom end 28 of pole 18 into ground sleeve 12. Tapered portion 82 is also illustrated in FIG. 11. 
     Second portion 70 of main body 66 extends from first portion 68 to closed end 64, and preferably has a transverse length and width slightly smaller than the transverse length and width of first portion 68. For example, second portion 70 may have the same transverse size and shape as pole 18 and a longitudinal length of approximately 11.75 inches. As second portion 70 is slightly smaller than first portion 68, the transition area between first portion 66 and second portion 70 forms the small shoulder or ledge 72 on the interior of main body 66. Preferably, the end of pole overlap section 46 ends just before ledge 72 such that flanges 32 and 34 define the point of contact upon insertion of pole 18 into ground sleeve 12, i.e. the bottom of pole 18 will not contact the ledge 72. 
     In accordance with another aspect of the invention, tubular members with the same transverse cross-sectional dimensions can be used to produce both pole 18 and ground sleeve 12. Thus, to form ground sleeve 12, one end of this tubular member is expanded in any conventional manner known in the metal working art to form first portion 68 and second portion 70 remains unaltered with the same transverse size as pole 18. In the alternative, ground sleeve 12 need not have a variation in its transverse size along longitudinal axis 19a and may have a constant transverse interior dimension for its entire length, which would be the transverse interior size of first portion 68. 
     Flange 34 has a shape and size corresponding to the shape and size of flange 32 on pole 18. Upper surface 74 of flange 34 is adapted to contact lower surface 58 of flange 32 and lower surface 76 of flange 34 is adapted to be positioned in the vicinity of top surface 13 of concrete 14 or ground 16. The thickness of ground sleeve flange 34 may be approximately 0.375 inches. Flange 32 includes at each of its four comers a clearance hole 78a, 80a, 82a, and 84a, each of which has about a 0.72 inch diameter to receive four 0.5 inch diameter opening nuts 78b, 80b, 82b, and 84b preferably welded to lower surface 76 of flange 32. Thus, weld nuts 78b, 80b, 82b and 84b define about 0.5 inch diameter openings each for receiving bolt 60. 
     The invention enables the size, width, and especially the length of flanges 32 and 34 to be reduced without sacrificing stability compared with the dimensions that would be required if pole overlap section 46 was not provided. For example, with the invention, 7 inch square pole and ground sleeve flanges can adequately support at least a basketball system with a 54 inch backboard and a 1,500 pound hang weight, which is measured off goal 24. However, other dimensions may be employed as will be recognized by the skilled artisan. For example, an enlarged flange may be provided, typically, in the range of approximately 7-10 inches when a heavier or larger basketball system is to be supported. In particular, 10 inch square flanges may be used to support a basketball system with a 72 inch backboard and a 6 inch pole. 
     Referring now to FIG. 11, a cross-sectional view taken along line 11--11 in FIG. 4 will now be discussed. As shown, bottom end 28 of pole 18 is guided into ground sleeve 12 via tapered opening 82 until lower surface 58 of flange 32 abuts upper surface 74 of flange 34. Accordingly, pole overlap section 46 is completely disposed in ground sleeve 12. As shown, pole overlap section 46 loosely fits into first portion 68 such that the outer periphery of pole overlap section 46 is adjacent the inner periphery of first portion 68 of ground sleeve 12. As discussed earlier, this loose fit facilitates removal of pole 18 from ground sleeve 12 without sacrificing stability. Bolts 60 are of the type having a head and a threaded shaft. The threaded shaft of bolt 60 is passed through, respectively, clearance openings 48, 50, 52, and 54 in flange 32, then through clearance openings 78a, 80a, 82a, and 84a in flange 34, and finally, are threaded into weld nuts 78b, 80b, 82b, and 84b provided on lower surface 76 of flange 34 until flanges 32 and 34 are secured together. 
     Referring now to FIG. 12, in combination with FIGS. 5, 6, 8 and 9, jacking devices shown generally at 90 will be discussed. In particular, to remove pole 18 from ground sleeve 12, bolts 60 must be removed and pole 18 must be withdrawn along longitudinal axis 19 until pole overlap section 46 is outside of ground sleeve 12. Generally, ground sleeve 12 is left behind. However, over time, the interface between pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, in particular, pole flange 32 and ground sleeve flange 34, may attach or become fixed to each other under the pressure of basketball system 10 weighing down on pole 18 in ground sleeve 12 and/or due to corrosion or exposure to the elements. If this occurs, pole 18 cannot easily be removed from ground sleeve 12 by a consumer. To overcome this problem, jacking devices 90 in accordance with the invention can force pole 18 to move longitudinally away from ground sleeve 12 and separate these parts. 
     In particular, jacking devices 90 include a pair of clearance openings 92a and 92b, preferably about 0.72 inch in diameter, passing through pole flange 32 for receiving weld nuts 94a and 94b, preferably about 0.5 inches in diameter, disposed on upper surface 56 of pole flange 32 in alignment with clearance openings 92a and 92b. Clearance openings 92a and 92b and weld nuts 94a and 94b are preferably centrally disposed on opposing sides of pole 18 to distribute their force equally across the interface between pole 18 and ground sleeve 12. Ground sleeve flange 34 remains unaltered and upper surface 74 of ground sleeve flange 34 abuts lower surface 58 of pole flange 32 to cover openings 92a and 92b. A pair of bolts 96a and 96b are screwed into weld nuts 94a and 94b and extend into clearance openings 92a and 92b, respectively. 
     When removal of pole 18 from ground sleeve 12 is desired, bolts 96a and 96b are rotated or tightened in weld nuts 94a and 94b causing ends 98a and 98b to abut upper surface 74 of ground sleeve flange 34. As bolts 96a and 96b continue to be tightened, pole 18 is forced apart from ground sleeve 12. In particular, lower surface 58 of pole flange 32 and the outer periphery of pole overlap section 46 are forced, as necessary, to separate from upper surface 74 of ground sleeve flange 34 and the inner periphery of ground sleeve 12. 
     Bolts 96a and 96b and the corresponding clearance openings 92a and 92b and weld nuts 94a and 94b are of a size, grade, and strength sufficient to create a force, upon tightening bolts 96a and 96b, that overcomes the force holding pole 18 to ground sleeve 12. For example, if a larger basketball system with a 72 inch board and 6 inch pole is to be removed, a higher grade bolt may be used. As shown, jacking devices 90 are positioned to effectively apply force to the entire interface between ground sleeve 12 and pole 18, however, a single or, in the alternative, additional jacking devices 90 and alternate dispositions of the jacking device(s) may be employed so long as they function in accordance with the invention. 
     Referring now to FIG. 13, another embodiment of the invention including reinforcing webs is illustrated. For example, web 100 may extend between side 42 of pole 18 and upper surface 74 of pole flange 32 to reinforce the connection between flange 32 and pole 18 and to limit or prevent flange 32 from deflecting. As shown, web 100 has a substantially flat trapezoidal shape, however, other shapes and configurations are contemplated. Similar webs may be formed between ground sleeve flange 34 and main body 66 of ground sleeve 12. Any quantity of webs may be used in accordance with the invention to achieve the desired strength. 
     In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 14-17 the pole flange is shaped particularly to provide additional strength. Moreover, in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, the ground sleeve flange also is shaped to facilitate alignment of the pole into the ground sleeve during installation. Only aspects of these embodiments that differ substantially from the embodiments described previously are discussed below. 
     Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, pole 18 has a flange 102 and ground sleeve 12 has a flange 104. In this embodiment, flange 102 is dome- or bell-shaped and includes a curved portion 103 and a flat portion 105, which is disposed substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis 19 and is adapted for attachment to flange 104 in the manner discussed above. Flange 102 is welded on pole 18 at both upper surface 56 and lower surface 58 as shown by welds 112. The outer dimension of flange 102 as shown is 7 inches square, for example. A peripheral cavity 110 is formed between lower surface 106 of flange 102 and upper surface 108 of flange 104. Cavity 110 may have approximately a maximum 1 inch longitudinal height. 
     Ground sleeve flange 104 is substantially the same as ground sleeve flange 34 discussed earlier, however, it is disposed on main body 66 slightly lower, approximately 0.375 inches, than open end 63 of ground sleeve 12 such that flange 104 can be welded on pole 18 at both upper surface 74 and lower surface 76 as shown by welds 112. In this embodiment, because part of flanges 102 and 104 are separated from each other by cavity 110, flanges 102 and 104 may be welded to pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, respectively, on both their upper and lower surfaces 56, 58, 74 and 76, respectively, without interfering with the interface between flanges 102 and 104. However, as discussed with reference to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-12, flanges 32 and 34 can be welded to pole 18 and ground sleeve 12 only on the sides facing away from the interface while still providing the required strength to support basketball system 10. This embodiment shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 also has the inherent advantage of a reduced amount of surface contact between flanges 102 and 104, which is advantageous to the removability aspect of the invention. 
     Referring now to FIGS. 16 and 17, an embodiment of the invention is disclosed where pole 18 includes tapered flange 113 and ground sleeve 12 includes tapered flange 114. Tapered flanges 113 and 114 are attached to pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, respectively, preferably by welding as described earlier, however, the welds are not illustrated. 
     More specifically, pole flange 113 has a tapered portion 116 extending outwardly toward ground sleeve 12 at an acute angle to longitudinal axis 19, however, linearly rather than curvilinearly as with flange 102. Flange 113 creates a small cavity 118 between a lower surface of flange 113 and an upper surface of flange 114 such that welds may be applied to both sides of flanges 113 and 114 so long as they do not interfere with the interface between flanges 113 and 114. Flange 113 also has a flat outer peripheral portion 117 that is disposed substantially perpendicularly to longitudinal axis 19 and is adapted for attachment to flange 114 in the manner discussed above. 
     Moreover, in this embodiment, ground sleeve flange 114 also has a corresponding peripheral tapered portion 120 extending from open end 63 of ground sleeve 12 at substantially the same acute angle to longitudinal axis 19 as tapered portion 116. This tapered portion 120 nests in cavity 118 of flange 113 thereby assisting in guiding and aligning pole 18 into ground sleeve 12 during installation. A flat portion 121 of flange 114 extends substantially perpendicularly to longitudinal axis 19 and is adapted for attachment to flange 112 in accordance with the invention. 
     Although not particularly shown in FIGS. 15-18, these embodiments of the invention may also include jacking devices 90 discussed earlier to facilitate removal of pole 18 from ground sleeve 12.","What is claimed is:

   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   The present invention relates generally to electric blankets. 
   Electric blankets typically include a heating element that extends through the blanket and through which electric current passes to generate heat. The heating element is disposed within passageways formed in the weaving process. 
   While not used in electric blankets, scrim laminate blankets tend to be very comfortable.  FIG. 1  shows a prior art scrim laminate blanket  10 . Blanket  10  includes a scrim layer  12  sandwiched between a pair of foam layers  14 . As should be understood in this art, scrim is an open weave or knit fabric, typically of synthetic yarn, used primarily to improve the structural integrity of a blanket assembly. During manufacturing, a laminating line typically draws the scrim layer and foam layer together adjacent to a flame, thereby bonding the layers together so that a foam layer covers both sides of the scrim layer. From the laminating line, a flocking range applies oriented fibers  16  to one side of the blanket. An additional pass in the flocking range applies the oriented fibers to the other side of the blanket. 
   The present invention recognizes and addresses disadvantages of prior art constructions and methods. 
   The accompanying drawings, which are incorporated in and constitute a part of the specification, illustrate one or more embodiments of the invention and, together with the description, serve to explain the principles of the invention.

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
   Reference is made in detail to presently preferred embodiments of the invention, one or more examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. Each example is provided by way of explanation of the invention, not limitation of the invention. In fact, it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications and variations can by made in the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit thereof. For instance, features illustrated or described as part of one embodiment may be used on another embodiment to yield a still further embodiment. Thus, it is intended that the present invention covers such modifications and variations as come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents. 
   Several preferred embodiments of electric blanket construction described herein include a heating element disposed in a laminated scrim blanket. The process of making a conventional scrim laminate blanket as shown in  FIG. 1  should be understood in this art. Generally, a scrim layer and two foam layers on either side of the scrim layer are fed into a lamination machine that laminates the three layers together. Alternatively, the foam layers may be bonded to the scrim layer in successive steps. 
   In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, a heating element is disposed on one side of the scrim layer prior to it&#39;s lamination to the foam layer on that side. Referring to  FIG. 22 , a scrim layer  12  and two foam layers  14  are fed from respective rollers  13  and  15  to a flame lamination machine  19 . Upon entering machine  19 , a flame heats the layers so that they become sticky and nearly melt. Pinch rollers  17  in the machine then press the layers firmly together. Upstream from machine  19 , a wire dispenser  21  deposits heating element wire  18  onto the upper surface of scrim layer  12 . The dispenser moves reciprocally (in a direction into and out of the page) transversely across the scrim layer as it moves in the direction indicated by arrow  25  toward the lamination machine, thereby depositing the heating element in a serpentine pattern on the scrim. The element, sandwiched between the scrim layer and foam layer following rollers  17 , is fixed between the layers by lamination machine  19 . In another embodiment, the lower foam layer is added to the underside of scrim layer  12  by a second lamination machine downstream from machine  19 . 
   Referring to  FIGS. 2A and 2B , another preferred electric blanket includes a heating element  18  disposed within parallel passageways  20  formed between scrim layer  12  and one of the foam layers  14 . An electrical plug (such as described below with respect to  FIG. 5 ) connects the heating element to an electrical power supply. Heating element  18  generates resistive heat responsive to the power supply. 
   The lamination process forms passageways  20  ( FIG. 2B ) between the scrim layer and one of the foam layers. As should be understood in this art, a lamination machine includes a series of flame jets extending across the width W of the blanket as the blanket passes below the jets in a direction indicated by arrow  19 . To form passageways  20 , flame jets are deactivated at positions corresponding to each passageway so that the lamination bond is not formed at these positions as the blanket moves in direction  19 . Passageways may be formed in a direction transverse to that shown in  FIG. 2B  by periodically disabling the entire flame as the blanket passes through the lamination process. After forming the scrim/foam laminate, a flocking range adds oriented fiber layers  16  to each side of the laminate. 
   The blanket material is cut into sections, and a rod feeds the heating element through successive passageways in each blanket section. Any suitable tool or machine, for example as described below, may be used to run the heating element through the passageways. Bindings (not shown) sewn to the blanket ends cover the exposed heating element at the passageway openings. An electrical plug (not shown) connects the ends of the heating element to a power cord and a control circuit as described below. 
     FIG. 3  schematically illustrates an electric blanket having a heating element layer  22  disposed between a pair of scrim layers  12 . Each scrim layer  12  is initially formed with a foam layer  14  laminated on only one side. After forming each scrim/foam laminate, a flocking range applies oriented fiber layers  16  to each foam layer. As described in more detail below with respect to  FIG. 9 , a wire dispenser disposed at the output of the lamination machine moves back and forth across the path of one of the laminate layers and deposits heating element wire on the layer&#39;s exposed scrim side. The two layers are then brought together so that wiring layer  22  is sandwiched between the two scrim layers, which are attached to each other by glue, heat seal, edge binding, or other suitable means, to form the blanket. In particular, adhesive or heat seal attachment holds the heating element in place between the scrim layers. 
   While the above examples include a scrim/foam construction, it should be understood that the present invention may include other suitable arrangements. For example, a wired scrim layer may be sandwiched between woven layers bonded to the scrim by adhesive or acrylic. 
     FIG. 4  illustrates one method of forming an electric blanket so that the heating element is woven into the blanket itself. A loom outputs a continuous sheet in which warp fibers run in three parallel longitudinal sections  22 ,  24  and  26 . Outer sections  22  and  26  are non-conductive and may be formed from any suitable non-conductive fiber. These sections preferably contain flame resistant fibers or are coated with a flame resistant material before or after the weaving process. Conductive fibers, such as carbon black or conductive polymer fibers or metallic fibers, yarns or wires (hereinafter referred to as “conductive fibers,” which should be understood to include all such materials), form middle warp section  24 . Suitable conductive fiber materials are available under the trademarks METALLINE from Expan of Korea, GORIX from Gorix of Great Britain, and SEIREN from Seiren Company of Japan. Respective wires  28  run between conductive section  24  and each non-conductive section  22  and  26 . Wires  28  are woven into the blanket and, in preferred embodiments, are metallic, carbon or polymer fibers of preferably 30–36 gauge. Each wire  28  may comprise a single conductive strand or may include multiple strands or fibers wrapped together. 
   The loom outputs weft fibers in three parallel transverse sections  30 ,  32  and  34 . Sections  30  and  32  are non-conductive and may be formed from any suitable non-conductive fiber, such as used in warp sections  22  and  26 . Conductive fibers, such as the fibers in section  24 , form middle weft section  34 . Respective sections  32  bound each middle section  34 . 
   The loom outputs a continuous sheet having blanket segments separated by fringe layers  30  that contain little or no weft fibers and at which adjacent blanket segments are cut from each other. The dimensions of any of the warp or weft sections described above may be varied as desired for a given desired blanket size. It should therefore be understood that the illustration in  FIG. 4  is not to scale and is provided for purposes of explanation only. 
   Due to the conductive and non-conductive weave described above, the interwoven conductive warp and weft fibers form a center weave section  36  composed entirely of conductive fibers. Side sections  38  and top and bottom sections  40  include conductive fibers in only one direction, while corner sections  42  include only non-conductive fibers. Accordingly, a voltage drop applied across wires  28  produces a wide area electrical distribution that heats center section  36 , while sections  38  and  40 , at which minimal current flow occurs, remain relatively unheated. 
   Referring to  FIG. 5 , a power plug  44  applies electrical power to wires  28  and may attach through a conventional power cord to a battery pack or a wire and plug unit for attachment to an in-line power source wall receptacle. Lead wires  46  extend from power plug  44  and attach to respective wires  28  through a metal foil blank  48 . Each foil blank  48  is sewn into blanket layer  12  or attached by other suitable means, for example ultrasonic welding. The blanket&#39;s side selvage areas are then folded over wires  28  and foil blanks  48 . The bottom hem is folded over wires  46  and plug  44 , and the two selvages and hems are sewn to form the blanket. A hole similar to a shirt button hole is cut in the lower hem at plug  44  for the plug&#39;s attachment to a power cord. Alternatively, and prior to attachment of the plug, foam layers may be laminated to either or both sides of layer  12 , and oriented fibers may be attached to the foam layers. Following attachment of the plug and wires, the blanket hems enclose the conductor wires and plug. 
   As should be understood in this art, the plug is typically a custom made injection-molded device. The ends of wires  28  are stripped, and a crimping tool crimps a pair of wire attachments in a jig to the stripped wire ends. An injection molding machine molds a plastic casing about the male ends of the wire attachments so that the resulting plug can receive the power cord&#39;s female end. 
   The blanket-forming procedure described above utilizes a predetermined blanket size. Referring to  FIG. 6 , however, conductive blanket layer  12  may be formed in a roll so that a blanket may be later cut to a desired length. In this embodiment, layer  12  again contains warp fibers divided into conductive center section  24  and two non-conductive side sections  22  and  26 . All weft fibers, however, are conductive fibers  34 . Wire bundles  28  are disposed at a predetermined interval, for example every six inches, transversely across the layer. As should be understood in this art, looms are capable of inserting wires  28 , and the particular weaving procedure is therefore not discussed in detail herein. Blankets of a desired length may be formed by making suitably spaced apart cuts across layer  12 . While this results in multiple wires  28  across the blanket, a power plug may be connected through its lead wires as described above to the outermost pair of wires to thereby heat the entire blanket. 
   To create a “zoned” blanket, in which different parts of the blanket may be independently controlled to desired heating levels, the blanket may include two sets of power plug/lead wires. For example, where a blanket is cut from conductive blanket layer  12  across the layer outward of wires  28   a  and  28   b,  a first power plug applied across wires  28   a  and  28   c  forms a first heating zone, and a second power plug applied across wires  28   b  and  28   c  defines a second heating zone. Thus, the left and right edges of the blanket sheet as shown in  FIG. 6  define the blanket&#39;s top and bottom edges when it is used. Referring also to  FIG. 7 , a hemming area may be left on either side of the outermost wires  28  in which to dispose power plug  44  in a suitable manner. These selvage areas may also include additional wires  28  that are not used for power delivery. That is, wires  28   a  and  28   b  are the outermost conductor wires in the blanket, although they are not necessarily the outermost wires in the sheet used to make the blanket. 
   Referring now to  FIG. 8 , the weft and warp fiber construction of scrim layer  12  is the same as described above with respect to  FIG. 6 . This embodiment, however, only uses two wire bundles  28 , each running longitudinally with the warp as in the embodiment discussed above with respect to  FIG. 4 . As in the previous embodiment, a blanket may be formed by cutting blanket layer  12  to any desired length. After cutting the layer and forming the blanket, the power plug and lead wires are disposed as shown in  FIG. 11 , and the power plug is folded or sewn into the hem. Accordingly, the left and right edges of the blanket sheet as shown in  FIG. 8  define the blanket&#39;s top and bottom edges when it is used. Control circuitry (discussed below) for controlling application of power to the heating element is external of the power plug and is disposed in-line with a power cord extending between a power source, for example batteries or an AC wall power source, and the power plug. 
   Such power plug/control circuit/lead wire arrangements may also be used with the earlier-described blankets in which a wire heating element is disposed on or in an otherwise non-conductive scrim layer. Referring to  FIG. 9 , for example, an oscillating dispenser (not shown) deposits a heating element  50  in a serpentine path on scrim layer  12 . Periodically, the dispenser loops the wire into and beyond the selvage area to enable the wire&#39;s connection to the lead wires of a power plug. If a blanket includes only one heating zone, the dispenser loops the heating element into the selvage area only at the blanket segment edges. For a dual-zone blanket, the dispenser also loops the wire the middle of the blanket segment. 
   As described above, the feeder may deposit wire  50  onto the scrim layer before or after lamination of the foam layers onto the scrim. The scrim and foam layers are then laminated together, securing the wire in place between the two layers. In another embodiment, however, foam layers are laminated to respective scrim layers before application of the heating element. A wire feeder disposed at the output of the lamination machine deposits the element on one of the two scrim layers, which is then adhered to the other scrim/foam pair so that the heating element is sandwiched between the two scrim layers. In either embodiment, the blanket, which may also include flocked layers of oriented fibers as discussed above, may be formed in a continuous roll and cut into individual sections. In each section, a hem receives the power plug and lead lines. More specifically, the wire loops are cut, power plugs are attached across the cut element ends by lead wires as discussed above, and the plug/lead wires are hemmed into the blanket edges. A hole is cut in the hem to provide access to the plug, and the hole edges are stitched to prevent fraying. 
   Wired scrim layers as described with respect to  FIGS. 2 ,  3 , and  21  (preferably without laminated foam layers and with the heating element attached to the scrim by adhesive or other suitable means)and conductive blanket layers as shown in  FIG. 4 , may be used to form an electric quilt. The particular arrangement of the heated layer may vary as desired, and it should be understood that the heating element may be disposed on any foundation on which the heating element is accessible to connection to a power source and protected against short circuit and which can be inserted into a quilt cover. Thus,  FIG. 10  illustrates a blanket layer  12  defining a heated center section  56  comprising, for example, a wire layer disposed on a foundation layer or a weave of conductive fibers. The wires or fibers extend into selvage areas  58 , which carry wire bundles for connection of area  56  to a power source. 
     FIG. 11  illustrates a comforter bag  60  made in any conventional manner. The bag includes top and bottom sides sewn on three edges so that the bag opens at the fourth edge. The bag receives layer  12  ( FIG. 10 ), along with any suitable batting, through the open edge  62 . Preferably, the batting is inserted first. As should be understood in this art, batting may comprise any suitable filler material, for example a web of soft bulky, usually carded, fibers. In one preferred embodiment, the batting is cut from a continuous non-woven polyester sheet. 
   The heating element, on a scrim or other substrate or as part of a conductive weave, is inserted on top of the batting. Alternatively, an unattached heating element wire may be pushed into the quilt by a tool having one or more elongated fingers that push the heating element into the quilt bag, leaving the heating element in successive loops on the batting when the tool is removed. The batting and scrim are both preferably non-flammable or self-extinguishing. Lead wires  46  are attached to the heating element through open edge  62 , and wires  46  and power plug  44  are folded or sewn into the quilt by a selvage section  64  as open edge  62  is closed. The bag is then flipped over, so that the heating element is below the batting, and a quilt pattern  61  is sewn through the quilt. A mechanical or electrical attachment skips the sewing head over the heating element in the quilt. 
   A quilt may also be formed by sewing a non-heated blanket layer, made from a weave, a scrim-based blanket or any desired blanket material, to a heated blanket along three of the blankets layers&#39; edges, thereby forming a bag with an open edge Referring to  FIG. 23 , a bag  63  includes a non-heated top layer  65  and a heated bottom layer  67  sewn together along three sides so that they define an open edge  69  through which a batting sheet  71  is inserted as discussed above. The fourth edge is then sewn, and a quilt pattern is sewn through the quilt. Heated layer  67  may comprise an electric blanket, for example a conventional prior art electric blanket, which should be understood by those skilled in the art, or blankets formed in the manners discussed herein, having a power cord  73  extending therefrom for connections to a power source and having control circuitry (such as described below) housed in a control box  75  in-line with the power cord. 
     FIG. 12  shows a schematic illustration of a control circuit for use with an electric blanket, indicated in phantom at  74 . The control circuit manages the heating element&#39;s temperature and detects shorts, opens and partial shorts in the heating element. The heating element is incorporated in the blanket in a conventional manner or in any of the arrangements described above and is indicated at  76  as a resistance. The resistance may represent a heating element in any suitable heated, generally planar spread, such as a blanket, quilt (e.g. as discussed above), mattress pads and heating pads, and the term “electric blanket” as used herein with respect to the control circuit should be understood to include all such spreads. 
   A 120 volt AC voltage source  70  powers the heating element through a full-wave bridge rectifier  72 , a sampling resistor  78  and a triac switch  80 . As should be understood by those skilled in this art, a triac switch conducts AC current between inputs  82  and  84  in both directions as long as an activating signal is present on a control lead  86 . If the activating signal is discontinued, the triac conducts current until the input signal&#39;s next zero crossing. 
   The activating signal is provided by an optically isolated triac driver  88  that acts as a switch passing current from node  84  to the control lead  90 . Thus, when driver  88  is activated by its control lead  90 , the signal from source  70  drives triac  80 . During this signal&#39;s positive cycle portion, current travels through triac  80  in the direction indicated by arrow  92 . During its negative cycle position, current travels through the triac in direction  94 . 
   A control circuit  96  controls driver  88 . Control circuit  96 , for example comprising a single integrated circuit (IC), may include a microprocessor and an A/D converter. Through the converter, the IC receives voltage measurements from nodes  98  and  100 . The measurement from node  100  is the voltage across sampling resistor  78 . Thus, the controller may determine the current through heating element  76  by dividing the voltage measured at  100  by the known resistance of sampling resistor  78 . The voltage applied to the system is measured at  98 . Thus, the system&#39;s total resistance is equal to the voltage measured at  98  divided by the current measured at  100 . The resistance of heating element  76  may therefore be determined by backing out the known resistances of the components upstream from the heating element. 
   As discussed above, the temperature of heating element  76  is related to its resistance. Wire manufacturers typically rate wire resistance with respect to a predetermined temperature, generally around 75° Fahrenheit. The manufacturer also typically provides the wire&#39;s temperature coefficient. Thus, given a known length L of heating element  76  having a temperature coefficient TC and a rated resistance X (in ohms per unit length) at Y° Fahrenheit, and given a measured resistance Z (in ohms) between nodes  98  and  100  as discussed above, heating element temperature T=Y+(1/XL) (Z−XL)/TC. 
   The variables Y, TC, X and L are known and may be stored in memory associated with control circuit  96 . Therefore, upon determining the measured resistance Z, the control circuit may determine the heating element&#39;s temperature T by the equation above. Alternatively, temperature T may be calculated over a range of resistances Z to create a table relating temperature to measured resistance. The table may then be stored in the control circuit&#39;s memory so that the control circuit, upon determining an actual measured resistance between nodes  98  and  100 , may determine temperature T by reference to the table. 
   The control circuit  96  may be disposed in a suitable housing attached to or within blanket  74 , for example in-line with a power cord between the power source and the heating element in the examples discussed above with respect to  FIGS. 1–11  and  23 . The control circuit may be configured for use with several different heating elements, whether of a wire, woven fiber or other suitable type, each having a range of possible measured resistances Z that does not overlap the range of any of the other heating elements. Thus, the measured resistance Z identifies which heating element the blanket contains, and the control circuit can then determine temperature T from the temperature coefficient TC and nominal temperature Y for that heating element or from a lookup table for that heating element. 
   Control circuit  96  manages the heating element temperature by various methods. Generally, however, the heating element&#39;s heat output varies predictably with current. Since triac  26  controls the amount of current passing through the heating element, the element&#39;s heat output may be determined by controlling the ratio of the triac&#39;s on-time to its off-time based on some predetermined scale. Various control methods are described in Applicant&#39;s U.S. Pat. No. 6,222,162, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated by reference herein. 
   In normal operation, control circuit  96 , driven by its microprocessor, may manage blanket temperature to a target temperature in a direct relationship to the heating element&#39;s measured resistance. Since a rise in measured resistance, and a drop in measured current, reflects a rise in temperature, the control circuit generally reduces current flow to the blanket responsively to a resistance increase, or current decrease, reflecting that the blanket&#39;s temperature is rising beyond the target temperature. Similarly, the control circuit reduces current flow to the heating element responsively to a measured resistance decrease, or current increase, reflecting that the blanket&#39;s temperature is falling beyond the target temperature. 
   The control circuit also responds, however, to conditions in which the normal relationships of current and resistance to temperature don&#39;t hold, such as opens, drastic shorts and partial shorts in the heating element. For example, while shorts may result in temperature increases, they also exhibit resistance decreases and current increases. A “drastic” short is a short circuit over a major portion of the heating element that causes a current increase significantly beyond a safe operating range. Accordingly, the control circuit stores a threshold resistance value that reflects the occurrence of a drastic short, and the control circuit disconnects the blanket&#39;s power when the measured resistance falls below this threshold. The particular threshold value depends on the heating element&#39;s characteristics, as should be understood by those skilled in the art. In a blanket having a typical heating element resistance of 100Ω, however, the control circuit disconnects power upon detecting a resistance of 80Ω or less. 
   Similarly, in another preferred embodiment, the control circuit disconnects the blanket&#39;s power when the current measured at 100 rises above a predetermined level. In a blanket having a typical current level of 1.1 amps, for example, control circuit disconnects power upon detecting a current level of 1.25 amps or more. 
   Heating elements are relatively long, and they may therefore be subject to “partial” shorts—short circuits across a limited portion of the element that produce a current increase relatively smaller than that of a drastic short. In particular, partial shorts may increase current to within a range experienced normally when the blanket is cold. The control circuit detects partial shorts, and differentiates them from a normal cold condition, based on the rate of change in the element&#39;s resistance or current. When the element&#39;s resistance or current changes due to acceptable temperature fluctuation, the change takes a relatively long time. For example, wire made from 34 gauge cadmium copper alloy takes thirty seconds or longer to change from 45° C. to 49° C., corresponding to a resistance change from 176.2Ω to 178.8Ω and a current change of 0.624 amps to 0.615 amps. Thus, assuming that this temperature change is acceptable, the control circuit should not interpret a 2.6Ω or a 0.007 amp change over a thirty second period to indicate a partial short. The circuit does recognize a partial short, however, if such a resistance or current change occurs within a period less than that acceptable for normal temperature fluctuations. The definition of this time period depends on operational factors such as the heating element&#39;s materials and dimensions. In one embodiment, for example, where a heating element is a 34 gauge cadmium copper alloy wire, the control circuit disconnects power to the heating element if there is a 0.5Ω resistance decrease or 0.002 amp current increase, or greater, from one current cycle to the next. Of course, other arrangements may be suitable under different circumstances. PTC wire, for example, has a relatively high temperature coefficient, and it&#39;s resistance may change relatively quickly without being subject to a short. In this instance, the control circuit may be configured to disconnect heating element power if the processor detects a cycle-to-cycle resistance change of 2Ω or more or a current change of 0.025 amps or more. 
   The control circuit also disconnects heating element power if it detects an open in the heating element. In a preferred embodiment, the control circuit disconnects power if it senses that the heating element&#39;s resistance is at or above, or if the current level is at or below, a threshold level that is sufficient to indicate an open has occurred. The particular threshold value for a particular heating element will depend on the element&#39;s characteristics. In one example, however, in which the heating element normally exhibits a 100Ω resistance and 1.1 amp current, the control circuit disconnects heating element power upon detecting a resistance of 200Ω or greater or a current of 0.55 amps or lower. 
   Accordingly, a measured resistance or current outside ranges that would be expected during normal operation may indicate an open or a partial or drastic short, and the control circuitry disconnects electricity flow to the heating element. Abrupt up or down resistance or current changes may also indicate these conditions, and the control circuitry therefore also disconnects power responsively to the rate at which these parameters change. 
     FIGS. 13 through 21  describe and illustrate the use of a machine for inserting a heating element into a blanket having parallel passageways to receive the element. Upon loading a blanket shell at a loading station, the machine propels a single heating element strand through the shell&#39;s passageways. The blanket shell material may be pre-formed to have two layers of fabric secured together along ending lines to provide parallel coextensive passageways between the material layers. It should be understood, however, that any suitable technique, for example those discussed above, may be used to form the passageways. 
   Referring to  FIG. 13 , a heating element insertion machine  120  (shown partially in  FIG. 13 ) includes a plurality of guide tubes  128  onto which a blanket shell  133  is initially loaded so that guide tubes  128  extend through each adjacent passageway. A continuous supply of blanket shell  129  is drawn over a frame  131 , which includes rollers  131   a  that supply the blanket shell material from directly above guide tubes  128 . After threading enough shell material onto the guide tubes for a single blanket shell  133 , the operator cuts the material transversely at the top of guide tubes  128  along a pre-marked line and then rumples shell  133  down over the tubes. 
   For purposes of clarity in illustrating the blanket loading procedure,  FIG. 13  omits a frame  122  ( FIGS. 14–16 ) that also forms part of machine  120 . Frame  122  would interfere with frame  131  if frame  131  were aligned directly above tubes  128  and frame  122  in their operative position. Accordingly, frame  131  is disposed to one side of frame  122 , and machine  120  therefore includes a mechanism to move the tubes away from frame  122  into a loading position as shown in  FIG. 13 . Referring to  FIGS. 13–16 , a movable carriage  144  carries guide tubes  128  and a tube support  130 . A pair of guide rails  146  slidably receives carriage  144  for transverse, horizontal movement with respect to frame  122 . Guide rails  146  extend transversely to the right and left of frame  122  a sufficient distance so that carriage  144  may be moved in either direction completely beyond frame  122  to loading positions, one of which is shown in  FIG. 13 , at which a frame  131  is located. After a blanket shell is placed over guide tubes  128  at the loading position and the shell is cut to form the single shell, carriage  144  moves to a central insertion station in front of frame  122  as shown in  FIGS. 14–16 . It should be understood by those skilled in the art that the carriage may be manually or automatically moved on the guide rails. 
   Carriage  144  includes a base plate  144   a  having a pair of slots that receive the guide rails. A platform  148  has a first end pivotally attached to the base plate and a second end attached to support  130 . A pneumatic piston is attached between platform  148  and the base plate. A lever (not shown) attached to platform  148  allows a user to pivot the platform and tubes between the positions shown in  FIG. 16 . 
   Frame  122  is generally box-like and has a plurality of vertically extending posts  122   b,  supports  122   a  and a plurality of horizontally extending braces  122   c  that combine to form the frame from which the various elements of the machine  120  are supported. A guide wall  124  at the upper front portion of frame  122  includes a rear guide wall  124   a  and a pivotally supported closure wall  124   b.  Hinges  125  pivotally connect the upper edge of closure wall  124   b  to rear guide wall  124   a.  Springs on hinges  125  urge closure of closure wall  124   b  to the position as seen in  FIG. 14 . 
   In front of frame  120 , guide tubes  128  are positioned between guide wall  124  and support  130  in a generally vertical position and are adapted to be tilted forwardly from the vertical position as shown in  FIG. 14  to the somewhat inclined position shown in  FIG. 15 . A pneumatic piston  124   d  pivots wall  124   b  between the positions shown in  FIGS. 14 and 15 , which define the operating and the load/unload positions, respectively. Suitable controls, for example including a microprocessor, for automatically controlling piston  124   d  should be understood by those skilled in the art and are, therefore, not discussed in detail herein. A handle  123  extending horizontally across the front of the wall  124   b  permits the machine operator to pivot the wall  124   b  manually when necessary. 
   Referring to  FIG. 17 , guide tubes  128  are elongated, each having a lengthwise extending passageway  28   a  therethrough in fluid communication with each other via upper and lower manifolds  129 . Guide wall  124  defines upper manifold  129 , while support  130  defines lower manifold  129 . Both upper and lower manifolds provide fluid communication between pairs of adjacent guide tubes to form a continuous path through tubes. Both upper and lower manifolds  129  are split to allow release of the heating element. Preferably, the manifolds contain a gasket positioned where the manifold halves abut each other to prevent undesirable air leakage within the manifolds. O-rings may be provided about the ends of the tubes where the tubes contact the manifold. 
     FIGS. 19   a  and  19   b  show an alternative embodiment in which guide tubes  228  are horizontally oriented. Tubes  228  extend through the blanket&#39;s passageways in a manner similar to the vertically oriented tubes. Each horizontal tube, however, is comprised of two interlocking halves that extend toward each other from opposing side manifolds. To load or unload a blanket shell onto the tubes, the manifolds and tube halves are pulled apart from each other, and the blanket shell is put on or removed from one set of tube halves or the other. The manifolds are then brought back together in their interlocking position. It should be understood that the manifolds may be disposed so that the guide tubes in this embodiment are vertical. 
   Tubes  228  have interior slots  230  that allow release of the heating element once it has threaded through the blanket. Each side manifold has a split construction with a pair of pivotally connected manifold halves  234 . Once the heating element is looped through all the tubes and the manifold passageways connecting adjacent tubes, the manifold halves open, and one or both side manifold(s) is/are pulled away from the other. Released from the manifold loop by the open manifold halves, the heating element slides through interior slots  230  as the tubes are pulled from the blanket passageways. 
   Returning to the embodiment shown in  FIGS. 13–16 , machine  120  pneumatically threads heating element strands through the guide tubes from a starting guide tube (rightmost tube shown in  FIGS. 14 and 17 ) to a final guide tube (leftmost tube shown in  FIGS. 14 and 17 ) preferably by an air stream provided to the starting guide tube by an air pressure source of approximately 30–50 PSIG, for example a shop air supply (indicated schematically at  133 ) controlled by a solenoid air valve. Typical shop air provides air at about 120 PSIG. In this case, a regulator may be used to provide the 30–50 PSIG at the guide tubes. 
   A shuttle  153  ( FIG. 18 ) receives the leading portion of the heating element and is inserted into a port  154  in the starting guide tube. Air flow within guide tubes  128  propels shuttle  153  through the guide tubes and the manifolds, thereby inserting the heating element wire within the blanket shell. Referring to  FIG. 18 , shuttle  153  has a diameter approximately equal to the passageway diameter within the guide tubes and is constructed from a pair of hemispheres that connect together to hold the end of the heating element. 
   Referring to  FIGS. 14 and 15 , the heating element is fed, prior to its insertion into the first guide tube, through a tensioning device  136  that is supported on the right end of frame  122 . Tensioning device  136  provides a controlled tension on the wire that inhibits slack in the wire as it is drawn through the blanket shell. A sensor in the tension device outputs a signal to a processor that also controls air source  133 . If the sensor detects tension below a certain threshold level indicating that the shuttle is jammed in the guide tubes or manifolds, or above a threshold level indicating that the heating element feed is jammed, the control procedure automatically shuts off the air supply. The particular threshold levels depend on various factors, such as the normal feed tension, air pressure, shuttle construction and heating element construction, and may vary as appropriate for a given arrangement. 
   As explained above, hinges  125  pivotally connect front closure wall  124   b  with rear wall  124   a.  In operating the machine, wall  124   b  is in the position shown in  FIG. 14  so as to close the various passageways and recesses through which shuttle  132  passes in its movement through guide tubes  128 . Once shuttle  153  passes through all guide tubes, it is removed from an output port in support  130  at the end of the leftmost guide tube, and the wire is removed from the shuttle by opening the shuttle hemispheres. The upper manifold  129  is then opened to release the wire; platform  148  and tubes  128  are pivoted to the forward position shown in phantom in  FIG. 16 ; the manifold halves in the lower manifold are opened, and the blanket shell is removed from the guide tubes. Like the horizontal guide tubes discussed above with respect to  FIG. 19   a  and  19   b,  vertical guide tubes  128  include side slots to allow passage of the wire loops as the blanket is removed from the tubes. 
   To summarize the operation of blanket wire insertion machine  120 , and referring first to  FIG. 13 , a carriage  144  is positioned in the load/unload position at which a blanket shell is inserted onto guide tubes  128  from the supply of material  129  having passageways formed therein. After moving the material downwardly onto guide tubes  128 , the material is cut off to a marked length for a single blanket shell. The carriage then is moved to the left or right, as appropriate, to the position shown in  FIGS. 14–16 . The operator pivots guide tubes  128  from the position shown in  FIGS. 15 and 16  to the vertical position shown in  FIG. 14 . At the same time, wall  124   b  pivots to the vertical position in which the top ends of guide tubes  128  are positioned adjacent the upper manifold  129  and guide walls  124 . The operator then inserts shuttle  153  into port  154  ( FIG. 17 ) after having attached heating wire  134  to the shuttle&#39;s trailing end ( FIG. 18 ). The machine propels the shuttle between the upper and lower manifolds until it threads through all of guide tubes  128 . At that time, shuttle  153  is driven through the output port—a horizontal passageway (not shown) in support  130  extending from the last guide tube. The operator then opens both manifolds  129  to release the heating element wire and pivots guide tubes  128  to the position shown in  FIG. 16 , at which time the blanket shell with its associated heating element may be removed upwardly from guide tubes  128 . 
   In another preferred embodiment, the heating element is inserted into a blanket shell having parallel passageways by a frame having a series of parallel fingers disposed correspondingly to the passageways in a manner similar to tubes  128  on support  130  ( FIGS. 13–16 ). Referring to  FIG. 20 , a heating element wire  314  is looped loosely over the tops of the fingers (indicated schematically at  324 ), and a blanket shell is drawn down over the fingers, in a manner similar to that discussed above with respect to  FIG. 13 , or the fingers are pushed into the shell. A lateral bar (not shown) attaches to the bottom ends of fingers  324  so that an operator or automated device gripping the frame may push the fingers up into the blanket shell. 
   As the shell moves over the fingers, the fingers push the heating element wire up into each passageway in a double strand. It will be understood that the heating element slides across the ends of the fingers as the fingers move up into the passageways, and grooves may be provided at the fingers&#39; ends to retain the heating element in position. The operator then cuts the material transversely above the finger tips or, if the shell is already cut, rumples the shell down over the fingers so that the finger tips and wire loops extend through the open ends of the passageways on the shell&#39;s other side. The operator inserts hooks or pins into the heating element loops at the finger tips and across the passageway openings to prevent the wire from sliding back into the passageways and pulls the blanket and fingers away from each other so that the fingers exit the passageways. 
   After the fingers&#39; removal, the blanket is stitched along lines  324  to prevent contact between sides of the individual wire loops in the passageways that might cause a partial short. In one preferred embodiment, sew tabs  322  may be attached at loop ends  320 . The tabs are stitched into the blanket selvages along the dashed lines shown at sides  316  and  318  to additionally secure the heating element. A plug  312  electrically attaches to the ends of the heating element, directly or through lead wires, and is folded into the blanket hem. 
   In another preferred embodiment, the heating element may be inserted into a blanket shell having parallel passageways on a foundation material, such as a scrim layer. Referring to  FIG. 21 , the heating element wire is deposited onto a scrim layer  326  in a serpentine pattern, for example by hand or by an oscillating dispenser as discussed above with respect to  FIG. 9 , and is secured to the scrim layer by adhesive or other suitable method, for example stitching or heat welding. The scrim is then cut from the left hand edge of layer  326  up into each wire loop, as indicated at lines  328 , so that the layer is segmented into parallel sections. A frame, such as discussed above with respect to  FIG. 20 , is placed on the foundation layer so that the tips of its fingers (indicated schematically at  324 ) engage the wire loops. The frame&#39;s fingers are then inserted into parallel pocket sections of a blanket segment (not shown) so that a heating element loop is disposed in each pocket. This can be accomplished by pushing the frame into the blanket segment or pulling the blanket segment over the frame. Following the frame&#39;s removal, the pockets may be sewn along lines  324  to provide additional separation between the wire in each loop. Sew tabs  322  may be attached at each loop end  320  for stitching into the blanket segment&#39;s selvage, which extends from the top and/or bottom half of the blanket segment beyond the passageway openings on either side of the blanket segment. 
   In another preferred embodiment, however, the sew tabs are omitted, and the foundation scrim layer extends some distance, e.g. six inches, beyond the ends of the wire loops on either side. This selvage material thus extends outward of the passageway openings on either side of the blanket segment. Preferably, the blanket segment&#39;s selvage extends from the top and/or bottom of blanket segment, and the scrim extensions are then sewn into the blanket&#39;s hem on both sides, thereby securing the scrim foundation and heating element wire in the blanket. 
   For power efficiency, a metallized MYLAR sheet may be laminated to the side of scrim layer  326  opposite the side to which the heating element is attached, or the scrim layer may include woven metallized fibers. Moreover, it should be understood that a heat reflective sheet, or the use of woven metallized fibers, may be employed with other blanket embodiments as discussed above. 
   While one or more preferred embodiments of the invention have been described above, it should be understood that any and all equivalent realizations of the present invention are included within the scope and spirit thereof. Thus, the embodiments depicted are presented by way of example only and are not intended as limitations upon the present invention, and it should be understood by those of ordinary skill in this art that the present invention is not limited to these embodiments since modifications can be made.

In open position the backboard segments fan out. The rod has a V-shaped attachment piece connecting the top of the rod to the common bottom border of the backboard.","FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
   The field of this invention is devices held by fans during sports activities to distract players, and more particularly, such devices that hand-held and used in basketballs games by basketball fans. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR ART 
   During basketball games, fans use thunder sticks to wave at players of the opposing teams during free throw attempts. The fans sit behind the areas facing the player doing a free throw and wave two air filled cylindrical balloons made of canvas in order to distract the player. These thunder sticks, as they came to be called, are simple and limited in value. They do not extend width-wise much more than the width of the fan&#39;s body. 
   SUMMARY OF THE PRESENT INVENTION 
   A fan waves a simulated basketball backboard including a rim and net. The backboard, made of parallel planar segments, emerges out of the top of a rigid plastic trunk when a push rod extending out of the bottom of the trunk is pushed up and fans out into an “open” position. Simultaneously the rim/hoop, which had been in “down” position adjacent the side of the trunk rotates 90 degrees to an “up” position perpendicular to the trunk. Rotation of the hoop is controlled by a two wheel pulley system inside the trunk that controls a hinge sitting in a groove carved out of the top front portion of the trunk, the groove bounded by brackets on each side and the horizontal pin of the hinge fitting into slots on each side of the opening. 
   When the rod extending our of the bottom of the trunk is pulled down, the parallel planar segments of the backboard go one behind the other and go downward to fit into the trunk and the hoop moves to a “down” position. In open position the backboard segments fan out. The rod has a V shaped attachment piece connecting the top of the rod to the common bottom border of the backboard. A spring keeps the legs of the V shaped attachment piece together (which helps causes the entire backboard to move downwardly into the empty hollow space of the trunk housing when the push rod is pulled down).

   DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT 
   The apparatus of the present invention will now be illustrated by reference to the accompanying drawings. The collapsible basketball backboard assembly of the present invention has been assigned reference numeral  10 . Other elements have been assigned the reference numerals referred to below. 
   As seen from  FIGS. 1-8 , a preferred embodiment of the collapsible basketball backboard assembly  10  of the present invention is provided. In accordance with this preferred embodiment, collapsible basketball backboard assembly  10  includes. As can be seen from  FIG. 1-8 , a collapsible basketball backboard assembly  10  comprises a hollow trunk  20  having a bottom end  22  and a top end  24 , the top end  24  is attached to a rotation control structure  30 . Trunk  20  is preferably rigid and is in one preferred embodiment made of rigid lightweight plastic. Trunk  20  is typically substantially cylindrical in shape and is somewhat wider at the top end  24  of trunk  20  to make it easier for the backboard  70  to easily fit into trunk  20  and easily emerge therefrom. The exact shape of trunk  20  is not limited to be limited to that shown in  FIG. 8  or in the other drawings. It is contemplated by the present invention that trunk  20  can have a variety of other shapes as long as it is long enough to accommodate the push rod  50  and pulley system  60  and wide enough on top to allow the backboard to enter and leave and easy enough to be portable and operated as described below. Furthermore, the shape of the top portion of trunk  20  depicted in  FIG. 8  is not intended necessarily to be consistent with the shape of the top portion of trunk  20  shown in  FIGS. 1-3  or  FIGS. 5A and 5B . Furthermore,  FIG. 8  is broken away at the top and therefore omits pulley system  60 , rotation control device  30 , backboard  70  and push rod  50  in and around top end  24  of trunk  20 . 
   In one preferred embodiment, trunk  20  is long and substantially cylindrical throughout its length except for its wider top portion  23 . 
   In a preferred embodiment, the rim  40  is attached to the top portion  23  of the trunk  20  which top portion  23  includes the top end  24  of the trunk  20 . 
   The rotation control structure  30  is any suitable structure that controls rotation of a rim  40 , the rim preferably having a net  42  attached thereto similar to the way nets are attached to basketball rims at the goal area of a basketball game. In one preferred embodiment, the rotation control structure  30  is simply a hinge  31  extending from and rigidly attached to the rim  40  (the rim having an attached net  42 ). As best shown in  FIGS. 5A ,  5 B and  FIG. 6 , the hinge  31  includes a horizontal stabilizing pin  31   a . Each end of this pin fits rotatably into left and right slots in an opening  25  carved out of the top end  24  of trunk  20  and is maintained in stable position using a left bracket and a right bracket located on each side of said opening. Opening  25  is bounded by a left bracket  26   a  and right bracket  26   b , the left bracket  26   a  adjacent a left slot  26   aa  in the opening  25  and the right bracket  26   b  adjacent a right slot in the opening  25 . Alternatively, in this preferred embodiment, the left bracket itself has a left recess and the right bracket itself has a right recess. 
   It is noted that while right bracket  26   b  appears in  FIG. 5A , this right bracket  26   b  is omitted in  FIG. 5B  for simplicity. In addition, although in  FIGS. 5A and 5B  push rod  50  appears to be located on the right side of the interior of trunk  20 , whereas in  FIGS. 1-3  and  FIG. 8  push rod  50  appears to be centered within trunk  20 , it should be understood that is contemplated by the present invention that push rod  50  can be anywhere within trunk  20  so long as push rod  50  can be pushed and pulled through trunk  20  to operate the present invention in conjunction with pulley system  60  of the present invention and  FIGS. 5A and 5B  are only intended to depict a schematic illustration of the operation of push rod  50  and pulley system  60  within trunk  20 . 
   Collapsible basketball backboard assembly  20  also includes a push rod  50  inside the trunk  20  substantially throughout the length of trunk  20  and extending out of the bottom end of the trunk  20 . In collapsed position, the push rod  50  extends approximately twenty inches out of the trunk  20 , whereas in open position the push rod  50  extends only a few inches out of trunk  20  or enough for handle  51  at the lower end of push rod  50  to be grasped. 
   In one preferred embodiment, the top portion of the push rod  50  includes a push rod assembly  55  that can include a substantially V-shaped structure  58  that connects the common bottom border  72  of the backboard  70  to push rod  50  in a way that transfers the downward force of the push rod  50  to the two halves of the backboard  70  so backboard  70  is forced down into trunk  20  in a single easy motion. Push rod assembly  55  may also include a spring  56  to make the legs of the V-shaped structure operate effectively. It should be emphasized that the present invention definitely is not limited to embodiments having a push rod assembly of the structure depicted in the drawings and contemplates any top portion of push rod  50  that successfully bring the backboard  70  into the trunk  20  and out again upon pulling and pushing of push rod  50 . 
   Collapsible basketball backboard assembly  20  also includes a pulley system  60  inside and attached to the trunk, one end of the pulley system connected to the push rod  50  and another end of the pulley system  60  connected to the rotation control structure  30 . Pulley system  60  typically includes two pulley wheels  61 ,  62  and string  63 . Lower wheel  62  has slack of string allowing multiple revolutions of string  63  around lower wheel  62  for the reason that push rod  50  needs to travel close to twenty inches upward when opening assembly  10  prior to pulling string  63  down. This because rotation control structure  30 , for example hinge  31 , moves much less than twenty inches in order to rotate rim  40  ninety degrees to its “up” position. 
   In a preferred embodiment, one end of string  63  has been inserted into a hole in hinge  31  and cannot return due to a knot. Any other suitable arrangement for locking string  63  to hinge  31  is also contemplated. The other end of string  63  of pulley system  60  is attached to push rod  50 . 
   Collapsible basketball backboard assembly  20  also includes a basketball backboard  70  comprising parallel planar segments  70   a ,  70   b ,  70   c ,  70   d ,  70   e ,  70   f ,  70   g , extending from a common bottom border  72  that folds lengthwise, for example in half at common bottom point  72   a . The segments  70   a ,  70   b ,  70   c ,  70   d ,  70   e  and so on, fit one behind the other when they are collapsed by folding along an imaginary center line bisecting the backboard  70 , which imaginary line is parallel to the length of the trunk  20  and crosses the common bottom point  72   a . The segments  70   a ,  70   b ,  70   c ,  70   d ,  70   e ,  70   f ,  70   g  fan out to form the appearance of one continuous planar basketball backboard  70  when the push rod  50  of assembly  10  is pushed to open and form backboard  70 . In a preferred embodiment, though, backboard  70 , in open position, is not actually smooth like a real basketball backboard since its segments,  70   a ,  70   b ,  70   c ,  70   d ,  70   e ,  70   f ,  70   g  are at different points of depth within backboard  70  in open position (and certainly in closed position although then they are not visible since they are within trunk  20 ). Preferably, adjacent segments are at adjacent levels of depth. For example, either segment  70   a  is in front and segment  70   b  is just behind it and segment  70   c  is just behind segment  70   b  and so on, or else the segments are structured in reverse so that segment  70   g  is in front, segment  70   f  is next behind it, segment  70   e  is next behind segment  70   f , and so on. It should be understood that in the open position the segments are not directly behind one another. As can be seen from  FIG. 1 , adjacent segments (i.e.  70   a  and  70   b  or  70   b  and  70   c  etc.) of backboard  70  are connected to each other only at common bottom point  72   a.    
   In should be noted that despite the appearances of  FIG. 1  showing planar segments  70   a ,  70   b ,  70   c ,  70   d ,  70   e ,  70   f ,  70   g , wherein the leftmost and rightmost planar segments  70   a  and  70   g  appear wider than trunk  20 , it is understood that in fact all planar segments are narrow enough to fit into trunk  20  in collapsed position and will fit one behind the other, as best shown in  FIG. 2 . Moreover, although  FIG. 2  only appears to depict four segments of backboard  70  one behind the other while  FIG. 1  shows seven such segments  70   a - 70   g , it should be appreciated that  FIG. 2  is not intended to show all the segments that may actually be present in the preferred embodiment 
   The present invention also contemplates dividing backboard  70  into a variety of segment shapes to accomplish its purpose including shapes not depicted in the drawings. In this regard, although in a preferred embodiment backboard  70  when opened should resemble the shape of an authentic basketball backboard, it is contemplated by the present invention that variations of this shape can also be used in the assembly  10 . In one embodiment, backboard  70  can be divided into triangular planar segments all of equal length and shape. 
   In addition, the present invention contemplates that the number of planar segments of backboard  70  can be increased or reduced in relation to the seven planar segments depicted in the drawings. 
   It is noted that in a preferred embodiment the backboard  70  of the assembly  10  of the present invention is typically twenty-four inches in width when opened fully. This is similar to a National Basketball Association regulation size backboard. The present invention contemplates that backboard  70  can be other widths as well, so long as they accomplish the purpose of distracting a basketball player of the opposing team. 
   As shown in the drawings, a top portion of the push rod  50  is connected to the common bottom border  72  of the basketball backboard  70  so that when the push rod  50  is pulled down to collapse assembly  10  the planar segments  70   a ,  70   b ,  70   c , and so on, fold and the common bottom border  72  folds at common bottom point  72   a  and backboard  70  enters the hollow space of the trunk  20 . At the same time, rim  40  falls or rotates downwardly by ninety degrees so that said rim  40  is substantially parallel to the trunk  20  and is alongside an outer wall of said trunk  20 . Then when push rod  50  is pushed upward to open assembly  10 , the backboard  70  opens and the rim  40  rotates ninety degrees upward so that said rim  40  is substantially perpendicular to the length of trunk  20 . 
   In operation, the fan would typically be positioned behind the goal area of a basketball stadium and when the opposing team&#39;s player is concentrating on a free throw, the fan would grasp assembly and push push rod  50  upward thereby opening backboard  70  and rotating rim  40  into position. It may be necessary to grip the top part of the trunk with one hand to make it easier to push the push rod  50  forcefully. In certain preferred embodiments trunk  20  has a sufficiently small diameter that a hand to grasp and substantially surround trunk  20 . Alternatively, the assembly  10  of the present invention contemplates having a piece  29  of the trunk housing  20  projecting outward from an otherwise smooth outer surface of trunk  20  in order to make it easier for a fan holding device  10  to grip the trunk  20  with one hand while pushing the push rid  50  with the other hand. Alternatively, a recess in the housing of trunk  20  can make it easier to grasp trunk  20 . 
   It is to be understood that while the apparatus of this invention have been described and illustrated in detail, the above-described embodiments are simply illustrative of the principles of the invention. It is to be understood also that various other modifications and changes may be devised by those skilled in the art which will embody the principles of the invention and fall within the spirit and scope thereof. It is not desired to limit the invention to the exact construction and operation shown and described.

     FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates generally to the field of heavier-than-air aeronautical craft that are sustained in air by the force of a fluid such as air. More particularly, the present invention relates to a homeostatic flying hovercraft and to a radio controlled flying saucer toy employing the principals of a homeostatic flying hovercraft. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     Ever since the term “flying saucer” was first introduced in 1947, the concept of a circular flying craft has become a staple of popular culture. Unlike conventional aircraft in which lift is produced by the difference between the air flowing over the top versus the bottom of a wing, most flying saucers have proposed using the aerodynamic effect of a spinning disc to at least partially generate the lift required for the craft. The flying disc toy known as the Frisbee® is perhaps the best example of this principal. While numerous concepts relating to spinning, flying disc-shaped craft have been put forth in a variety of patents and publications, a practical embodiment of a self-powered flying saucer has yet to be developed. 
     The concept of a heavier-than-air craft supported by a fluid instead of wings or rotors predates even the Wright brother&#39;s first flight. U.S. Pat. No. 730,097 issued in June 1903 described an airplane controlled by a jet propulsion arrangement that proposed using a pendulum valve to control the operation of the jets as an automatic means to keep the craft in equilibrium. Despite numerous attempts to realize the concept of a craft suspended by downward directed jets, it was more than sixty years later before the Harrier jump jet actually achieved this goal with the first practical vertical-take-off-and-landing (VTOL) aircraft. Even so, the difficulty in controlling and maneuvering such a VTOL aircraft on both take-offs and landings, as well as transitions from vertical to horizontal flight, continues to plague the general acceptance of VTOL aircraft as evidenced by the ongoing difficulties with the US Marine Corp&#39;s V-22 Osprey aircraft. 
     Various attempts have been made to use the inherent stability of a spinning disc or multiple spinning disc arrangement in order to stabilize a fluid suspended flying craft Examples of the use of jet propulsion in connection with a spinning disc are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,199,809, 3,503,573, 3,946,970, 4,566,699, 5,351,911, 6,050,250, 6,302,229, 6,371,406, 6,375,117, 6,572,053, and 6,575,401. Other examples of spinning annular rings or discs in a saucer-shaped craft are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,863,261, 4,214,720, 4,273,302, 4,386,748, 4,778,128, 5,072,892, 5,259,571, 6,053,451, 6,270,036, and 6,398,159. 
     Another approach to supporting a heavier-than-air craft has involved the use of ducted fans, instead of jets or rotors, to provide the necessary thrust for supporting and propelling the craft. Patents directed to the use of ducted fans to support a heavier-than-air craft date back to as early as 1872 and include craft that relied solely on ducted fans (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 129,402, 905,547, 931,966, 996,627, and 1,816,707), as well as craft that used ducted fans in combination with wings (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,291,345, 1,405,035, 1,959,270, 2,461,435, 2,968,453 and 6,547,180) or craft using ducted fans in a helicopter-like craft (e.g. U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,911,041, 2,728,537, 3,199,809, 5,503,351, 6,402,488, and 6,450,446). 
     The first non-spinning disc shaped aerial craft with a single central ducted fan arrangement, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,567,392, used shutters to control airflow and orientation of the craft. The problem with this arrangement is similar to the problems encountered with helicopters, namely the rotation of a single fan imparts a one-way spin or torque that must somehow be counteracted in order for the craft to remain stable. Most central ducted fan arrangements have since utilized the concept of two counter-rotating blades spinning on the same axis in opposite directions to overcome this single-fan torque problem. The most famous application of this concept was the 1950&#39;s Hiller flying platform as described in U.S. Pat. No. 2,953,321 that was based on work dating back to 1947 by Zimmerman. The Hiller flying platform was controlled by having the operator shift his weight to alter the center of gravity of the craft. 
     Other craft that use the co-axial counter-rotating blades for a central ducted fan arrangement have used vanes, louvers and duct arrangements to control airflow from the ducted fans in order to control orientation of the craft (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,728,537, 3,442,469, 3,677,503, 4,795,111, 4,804,156, 5,178,344, 5,203,521, 5,295,643, 5,407,150, 6,450,445, and 6,588,701). Patents also have described craft that use a pivoting central ducted fan arrangement to control airflow and orientation (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,730,311, 2,876,965, 2,968,318, 5,421,538 and 6,224,452). Still other patents have described central ducted fan craft that used variable pitch angle blades to control the airflow and orientation of the craft (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,968,318, 3,002,709, and 3,395,876). The addition of tail fins and tail rotors or tail jet engines to a central ducted fan craft has been described in several patents (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,988,301, 4,796,836, 5,035,377, 5,150,857, 5,152,478, 5,277,380, 5,575,438, 5,873,545, 6,270,038, 6,457,670, and 6,581,872). The addition of a gyroscope mounted to and rotated by the propellers of the ducted fan to aid in stabilization of the craft has been described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,461,436 and 6,604,706. Combinations of one or more of the control techniques have also been proposed in many of these patents as well as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,196,877. 
     Ever since the 1950&#39;s, there have been sporadic research projects sponsored primarily by various military organizations on the design of enclosed rotorcraft vehicles. All of these designs to date have utilized a single-axis rotor inside a cowl or protective ring arrangement that forms a ducted fan. The most successful implementation of a single-axis counter-rotating ducted fan arrangement has been the Cypher™ unmanned air vehicle (UAV) from United Technologies Corp. that operates as a single-axis VTOL craft. The Cypher™ has been effectively used as a drone surveillance probe by the military when remotely piloted by experienced UAV pilots. 
     Recently, the military has started funding development of smaller unmanned air vehicles known as Organic Air Vehicles (OAVs) that are intended to be small (&lt;24″ diameter) field-deployable remote controlled flying vehicles. Two multi-million dollar research and development contracts were granted in 2001 for the OAV program. Both contracts sought to extend the single-axis VTOL concept that is the basis for all military enclosed rotorcraft into a number of smaller sizes. The VTOL craft for the OAV program is designed to be oriented upright for takeoff and landings and transition into a sideways orientation for flight. As one might expect, the trickiest part of controlling this craft occurs during the transitions between vertical and horizontal orientations. 
     In March 2002, the OAV design from Honeywell known as the Kestrel was selected for further funding. The Kestrel design is a conventional VTOL single axis rotorcraft that looks like a 5 pound coffee can with bunny ears and legs and is powered by a gas engine in the center and a pair of fuel carrying/payload bearing pods mounted on the sides. The Kestrel design has three sizes from 9-29 inches, with payloads ranging from 8 ounces to 18 pounds and an expected price tag of $10,000-$25,000 per unit. Available information indicates that these OAV&#39;s are being designed for automated self-piloting based on GPS coordinates and complex object recognition vision systems. Currently available information indicates that the smaller OAV models of the Kestrel project are still not ready for use. For more information on the current status of unmanned aircraft development, see “Future of Unmanned Aviation,” Popular Science, June, 2003. 
     One alternative to the VTOL central ducted fan arrangement is the use of a pair of counter-rotating ducted fan arrangements that has been proposed in both side-to-side and front-and-back positions in a craft (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,077,471, 2,988,301, 3,752,417, 5,049,031, 5,064,143, 5,213,284, 5,746,930, 5,890,441, and 6,464,166). A very early proposal for a ducted fan craft using more than a pair of ducts was described in 1911 by Gridley in U.S. Pat. No. 1,012,631. Grindley showed the use of four ducted fans to produce a balanced (even) effect on the plane of the body of the craft, but no control arrangement for the fans was described. U.S. Pat. No. 4,795,111 described an alternate embodiment of a UAV that employed four ducts and briefly proposed altering fan pitch control or throttle control as a means for controlling this embodiment. U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,179,247 and 6,254,032 describe proposed flying passenger craft that use ten or more ducted fans arranged in an equidistant manner in a ring around the craft. Both patents briefly describe a control system that varies the throttle control of different engines. U.S. Pat. No. 6,179,247 also proposes the use of a moveable paddle system to deflect air for purpose of control, whereas U.S. Pat. No. 6,254,032 also proposes that each ducted fan is individually pivotable to control airflow direction. 
     Until recently, most development efforts in heavier-than-air craft that are fluid sustained using ducted fans of the like have been focused on larger passenger aircraft of UAVs. Recent advances in battery technology have generated a renewed interest in the field of remote controlled aircraft and smaller OAVs. Instead of conventional gas-powered engines, a combination of high-powered batteries and light-weight electrical motors have been used as replacement engines for model airplanes and model helicopters. While this represents an improvement in terms of simplicity and operability, model airplanes, and particularly model helicopters, are still expensive, complicated, temperamental and fragile hobby toys that can require months to build, learn, rebuild and master. 
     Various powered spinning disc toys and models have attempted to address the control and stability problems associated with model airplanes and model helicopters using many of the same approaches described above. These include single rotor model craft (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,394,906, 3,477,168, 3,528,284, 3,568,358, 3,608,033, 4,065,873 and 5,429,542), dual counter-rotating rotor model craft (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,949,693, 5,071,383, 5,634,839, 5,672,086, and 6,053,451) and even rocket or jet-powered models (e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,508,360 and 4,955,962). U.S. Pat. No. 5,297,759 describes a disc-shaped model craft that uses two conventional aircraft propellers mounted at an angle of about 30 degrees on the surface of the disc to rotate the disc to provide both lift and propulsion. 
     More recently, variations on the conventional model helicopter have been introduced utilizing multiple main rotors, each powered by a separate electrical motor. The Hoverfly® II is perhaps the best example of such a craft that utilizes three main rotors and a tail rotor in a classic helicopter format. The Ultimate Flying Saucer™, the GyroSaucer™ and the DraganFlyer III™ utilize four rotors (two pairs of counter-rotating rotors) in a helicopter-like fashion to provide lift for the model craft, but do not have a separate tail rotor. Instead, the DraganFlyer III™ uses three piezoelectric oscillation gyros to transmit flight data to an on-board computer to provide balanced reciprocal thrust among the rotors. Another variation on this approach is the Vectron™ Blackhawk that integrates a rotating outer ring with three rotor blades to provide lift for the craft. 
     Unfortunately, each of these craft is still difficult to control and maneuver and all of these craft rely on multiple conventional helicopter rotors to provide aerodynamic lift, rotors that are easily damaged in the event of a crash. Like all exposed rotor craft, these multi-rotor models are also inherently dangerous due to the exposed spinning rotors. 
     The most extensive research project using ducted fans instead of rotor blades was conducted by a research group at Stanford University for a NASA project to design miniature flying craft to be used for aerial mapping of Mars. The design known as a “mesocopter” calls for a very tiny battery-powered four rotor craft less than two inches across. In one version, the four tiny rotors are each shrouded in a protective ring. While the research is interesting, the project has no practical guidance on how to make a model-sized RC flying craft for here on Earth because of the differences in gravity and air density as compared to Mars. 
     A design concept for a model flying hovercraft powered by ducted fans has been proposed by a student at MIT. Although his design proposed the use of counter-rotating ducted fans to power the craft, he has never been able to make the design work. Control of his 4 ducted fan design was to be achieved by using three separately controlled fins, one for yaw, one for left-right and one for back-forth. While some interesting concepts were proposed, a workable prototype was never achieved and no further work on the project has been reported. 
     Whether the craft is a single-axis VTOL, ducted fan UAV or OAV, a multi-rotor model RC craft, or a multiple ducted fan craft, the main challenges with all of the existing designs for fluid sustained aircraft are ease of control and stability of flight. Manually flying any of these craft requires extensive training and skills. Unfortunately, the automated self-piloting systems capable of attempting to assist with flying any of these craft are all based on the complicated and expensive inertial guidance auto-pilot systems used in airplanes today. 
     Existing autopilot systems, such as the state-of-the-art Honeywell Fault-Tolerant Air Data Inertial Reference System (FT/ADIRS), use one or more gyroscopes to sense rotation about an axis in the form of angular velocity detection. The FT/ADIRS, for example, is comprised of a six-sided structure holding six ring laser gyros and six accelerometers. A myriad of backup and redundant power supplies and computer systems are integrated with this system to prevent a mid-flight failure. 
     The basic reason for the use of very high precision laser ring gyros and multiple redundancies is that existing inertial guidance systems all rely on an initial static determination of the gravitational reference to be used by the system. In the case of an autopilot system, the gravitational reference or ground horizon reference is established when the plane is on the ground. This process, commonly referred to as boresighting, establishes the gravitational reference for down. Once this gravitational reference is established, it is essentially static and unchanging and the auto-pilot system uses the gyros to keep very precise track on a dead-reckoning basis of all changes in the attitude of the craft from the point of the ground plane reference. This complicated referencing to a static ground plane reference can be augmented dynamically by obtaining positional information from a global positioning satellite (GPS) system, but GPS systems are not precise enough to detect small changes in attitude of a craft on a continual basis. 
     Ideally, the ground plane reference could be dynamically updated on a continual basis when the craft was in the air, thus eliminating the need for the complicated gyro based inertial guidance systems. Unfortunately, mechanical sensors such as pendulums, gyros and piezo-accelerometers do not function the same in dynamic situations where the sensors are continually subjected to multiple acceleration fields. The impact of precession on those sensors means that the sensor readings will provide an incorrect ground plane reference. By example, a pendulum is a very simple and effective gravitational sensor in a static context. If a pendulum is subjected to a centripetal acceleration in addition to gravitational acceleration by swinging the pendulum in a circle, for example, then the “reading” of the pendulum will not point down. Instead, the pendulum will point in a direction that is a combination of both the gravitational acceleration and the centripetal acceleration. This phenomenon is further complicated in situations where the craft is in a parabolic dive, for example, when the tilt of the craft is equal to the rate of acceleration of the dive. In this situation, referred to as the “death spiral,” the forces on sensor are balanced so that the sensors typically give no useful output readings in this situation. 
     U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,843 describes a virtual navigator inertial angular measurement system that uses gyros to sense angular velocity and piezo-accelerometers to correct for drift in the gyros. While the piezo-accelerometers are referred to in this patent as “absolute” references, it is understood that these piezo-accelerometers are absolute only with respect to the initial gravitational ground plane established by a boresighting process. The need for this initial boresighting is confirmed by the fact that the invention touts the advantage of being stable for long periods of time. If an inertial guidance system were able to dynamically update its initial gravitational ground plane, then the need for “stability” over extended periods of time is eliminated. 
     Examples of current state of the art inertial navigational reference systems for aviation that use a gyro-based angular rate sensing arrangement similar to that described in U.S. Pat. No. 5,854,843 are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,440,817, 5,676,334, 5,988,562, 6,227,482, 6,332,103, 6,421,622, 6,431,494, and 6,539,290. While certain references indicate that a gyro sensor can be a gravitational detector of down, it must be understood that this statement is valid only under static conditions or in a limited set of acceleration circumstances where the output of the sensor is not compromised by the acceleration fields. U.S. Pat. No. 6,273,370 attempts to overcome these limitations by trying to keep track of different states of the sensor system and determining a course of action based on the different state conditions. Still, if the sensor system loses track of the state of the sensor system, even this arrangement cannot dynamically determine an inertial gravitational reference to use as a reference. 
     What is needed is a heavier-than-air flying craft that has the ability to hover and to perform vertical air movements like a conventional model helicopter, yet is easier to operate and more durable than existing flying machines. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention is a homeostatic flying hovercraft that preferably utilizes at least two pairs of counter-rotating ducted fans to generate lift like a hovercraft and utilizes a homeostatic hover control system to create a flying craft that is easily controlled. The homeostatic hover control system provides true homeostasis of the craft with a true fly-by-wire flight control and control-by-wire system control. 
     In one embodiment, the flying hovercraft is a flying saucer shaped over-powered skirtless hovercraft capable of up/down, lateral and yaw, pitch and roll flight maneuvers by mimicking the position of the craft to the position of a remote controller. Preferably, control is fluidly intuitive by seamlessly utilizing a series of pre-established operational orientations associated with each of the positions of the craft that result in balanced and controlled flight positions. The homeostatic hover control system removes the need for the pilot to be concerned with moment-to-moment balance/stabilization and control of the craft and focus instead only on the intended motion in which the craft is to be directed. 
     Instead of trying to use the rotation of the craft or the spinning of rotor blades to provide aerodynamic lift, the preferred embodiment of the homeostatic flying saucer uses four battery-powered ducted fans housed completely inside the craft to produce four controlled cones of thrust beneath the craft. A novel control system balances the four cones of thrust to keep the craft stable and to cause the craft to move in a desired direction. The fan blades are specially designed to make the most efficient use of the increased power provided by permanent magnet motors while also reducing fan noise both because the blades spin somewhat slower than conventional blades and because of the unique aerodynamic design features of the ducted fan blades. 
     The homeostatic control system of the preferred embodiment incorporates many different features to enable the craft to achieve homeostasis or self-stabilization. The ducted fans are angled slightly outward such that the four cones of thrust have an inherent balancing effect, much like the bottom of a Weeble® toy that wobbles but doesn&#39;t fall over. The four ducted fans are actually two pairs of counter-rotating fans on opposite sides of the craft. The counter-rotation eliminates the need for anything like a tail rotor to prevent spinning of the craft caused by the spinning of the fans. A hover control system manages the amount of thrust produced by each ducted fan via four speed controllers. The hover control system uses an XYZ sensor arrangement and associated control circuitry that dynamically determines an inertial gravitational reference for use in automatically and continuously determine the speed needed for each fan in order to keep the craft at a desired orientation. Other embodiments of the hover control system support collision avoidance sensors and the ability to automatically change the way the flying hovercraft operates depending upon whether the craft is indoors or outdoors. 
     In a preferred embodiment, light-weight, high-torque permanent magnet motors power the ducted fans. The preferred embodiment of such permanent magnet motors are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,236,561 and 6,342,746, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference. Unlike conventional electric motors that use electromagnetic force created by a series of wound coils within the motor to rotate a shaft, these permanent magnet motors control the flow of magnetic flux from powerful permanent magnets to rotate the shaft of the motor. Consequently, when these permanent magnet motors are used to turn a heavy load the motor does not draw additional current from the battery. These one-of-a-kind electric motors provide a combined total in excess of ½ horsepower to the shafts of the four ducted fans, enabling an anticipated thrust-to-weight ratio of greater than 2:1 and preferably greater than 3:1 for an unloaded saucer. As a result, the saucer of the preferred embodiment is able to fly longer and farther than if it were powered by conventional motors that draw increasing amounts of current from the battery in response to increasing loads on the motor. 
     The unique and intuitive one-handed bee controller also includes an XY sensor arrangement and associated control circuitry that allows the craft to mimic the position of the controller in terms of yaw, pitch, roll and lateral flight maneuvers. In one embodiment, control of the craft is fluidly intuitive by seamlessly utilizing a series of pre-established operational orientations associated with each of a set of positions for the craft that result in balanced and controlled flight orientations. Together, the homeostatic control system and the bee controller eliminate the need for the pilot to be concerned with moment-to-moment balance/stabilization. In one embodiment, the bee controller also features a USB connection port to permit downloading of software updates from the web via an Internet connection. 
     Unlike existing RC models that use inexpensive low frequency one-way communications, the preferred embodiment of the present invention incorporates state of the art radio frequency communications. A unique 900 MHz communication chip provides a two-way, multi-channel communication link between the controller and the saucer. This high speed multi-channel communication link allows multiple saucers to fly in the same area and communicate with each other to make advanced gaming and coordinated control possible. It also permits extensive data communications both to and from the saucer. Video images and other high bandwidth sensor inputs can be communicated from the saucer to the controller over this link. 
     In the preferred embodiment, multiple onboard microprocessors receive commands from another microprocessor in the bee controller and, in response, instruct the homeostatic control system on a desired orientation, angle and thrust for the craft. Preferably, radio communications between the microprocessor and the bee controller are used to keep the craft within a programmed maximum distance from the controller and the microprocessor automatically slows and reverses the craft when it approaches the maximum range from the controller. For one embodiment of an RC craft, the maximum distance is 500 feet from the bee controller and the maximum speed is about 25 mph. 
     In a preferred embodiment, instead of heavier, conventional NiCad rechargeable batteries, state-of-the-art Lithium Polymer rechargeable batteries are used as the electrical power source for powering the permanent magnet motors. Lithium Polymer batteries provide the long-life and high power capacity required for this technology in the lightest and smallest package. 
     In a preferred embodiment, the flying hovercraft is an RC flying saucer that is constructed of a single EPP foam shell weighing between 30-42 ounces unloaded. Although light-weight, the saucer is designed to withstand free falls of up to 5 feet without damage. Even though it is as lightweight as styrofoam, the advanced EPP foam that forms the shell is actually able to bend and still return to its original shape without breaking.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
     As illustrated in  FIGS. 16-20 , a preferred embodiment of a homeostatic flying hovercraft  200  is presented in accordance with the present invention. The homeostatic flying hovercraft  200  has generally an ellipsoid shaped body  200 , having an upper surface  202  and bottom surface  204 . As illustrated in  FIG. 18 , the upper surface  202  is comprised of a solid outer ring  206  of the saucer body  200  that extends radially inwards from the periphery and an removeable cover  208  containing a plurality of ventilation openings  210 . Preferably, the cover  208  has a slightly greater curvature as compared to the outer ring  206 . The lower surface  204 , as illustrated in  FIGS. 17 and 20  is a solid structure with four equally spaced circular duct openings  212 . As illustrated in  FIG. 19 , each duct opening  212  preferably is angled at ten to fifteen degrees from the vertical and contains a battery-powered ducted fan  214  mounted inboard from the duct opening  212 . 
       FIG. 21  provides a side cutaway view of the homeostatic flying hovercraft  200  highlighting the placement of one of the battery-powered ducted fan  214 . The cover  208  is structurally supported about its outer radius and by a central support pillar  216 . The remainder of the structure, comprised of the area between the lower surface  204  and under the outer ring  206  of the upper surface  202  is comprised of a lightweight material such as a single EPP foam shell. Preferably, an air chamber  216  defined between cover  208  and upper surface  202  is upstream from fan  214  and has a frustoconical shape to expand the volume of available air. 
     Each fan  214  is powered from an internal pair of batteries  216 . Instead of heavier, conventional NiCad rechargeable batteries, state-of-the-art Lithium Polymer rechargeable batteries are used as the electrical power source for powering the permanent magnet motors. Lithium Polymer batteries provide the long-life and high power capacity required for this technology in the lightest and smallest package. Motor wire channel  218  operably connects the battery  216  to the fan  214 . 
       FIGS. 22   a  and  22   b  illustrate the hand-held bee controller  220  of the homeostatic flying hovercraft  200 . The hand-held bee controller  220  preferably includes a control stick  222  mounted on the upper control surface  224  for thumb control. Directly below the control stick  222  on the upper control surface  224  are a plurality of directional LEDs  226  and a LED power indicator  228 . The directional LEDS  226  are disposed to represent the four directions. The hand-held bee controller  220  is designed to be held in the palm of one hand so that the fingers contact the four-way video control pad  230  and power button  232  while the thumb engages the control stick  222 . Preferably, a USB port  234  is disposed on the aft face  236  along with antenna  238 . The USB connection port  234  permits downloading of software updates from the web via an Internet connection. 
     Unlike existing RC models that use inexpensive low frequency one-way communications, the preferred embodiment of the present invention incorporates state of the art radio frequency communications. A unique 900 MHz communication chip provides a two-way, multi-channel communication link between the controller  220  and the saucer  200 . This high-speed multi-channel communication link allows multiple saucers to fly in the same area and communicate with each other to make advanced gaming and coordinated control possible. It also permits extensive data communications both to and from the saucer  200 . Video images and other high bandwidth sensor inputs can be communicated from the saucer  200  to the controller  220  over this link. 
     It will be recognized that use of the hand-held bee controller is not limited to a flying saucer but can by used to remotely control any radio controlled (RC) aircraft in a true control-by-wire, fly-by-wire construct. The hand-held RC controller includes a body adapted to be held in one hand. A homeostatic control system IS positioned within the body to sense a desired orientation of the RC controller by a user selectively positioning an orientation of the RC controller. The homeostatic control system includes an XYZ sensor arrangement and associated control circuitry as previously described that dynamically determines an inertial gravitational reference for use in sensing the desired orientation. The RC controller also includes a bidirectional radio frequency (RF) transceiver providing two-way RF communications between the RC aircraft and the hand-held RC controller that communicates the desired orientation to the RC aircraft. 
     The RC aircraft includes at least one motor that provides motive force to the RC aircraft and a power source operably connected to the at least one motor and carried within the RC aircraft. The motor and power source can be electric or gas powered. A homeostatic control system is operably connected to the at least one motor to automatically control the motor in order to maintain the desired orientation of the RC aircraft. The homeostatic control system also includes an XYZ sensor arrangement and associated control circuitry as described above that dynamically determines an inertial gravitational reference for use in automatic control of the at least one motor. Finally, the RC aircraft has a bidirectional radio frequency (RF) transceiver providing two-way RF communications between the RC aircraft and the hand-held RC controller. 
     The ducted fan assembly  214  is illustrated in  FIGS. 23-27   d .  FIG. 23  is a cutaway view of one of the ducted fan assemblies  214  of the homeostatic flying hovercraft  200 . Each ducted fan assemblies  214  includes a motor mount  240  that is dimensioned to receive the motor  242 . Each motor  242  is further comprised of an exterior rotating rotor  244  and an interior fixed stator  246  that is operably mountable in motor mount  240 . A fan blade  248  is operably mounted on the exterior rotating rotor  244 . The fan blades  248  are specially designed to make the most efficient use of the increased power provided by permanent magnet motors  242  while also reducing fan noise both because the blades  248  spin somewhat slower than conventional blades and because of the unique aerodynamic design features of the ducted fan blades. 
     There are at least six fan blades  248  extending from a central mounting hub  250  that is generally concentrically aligned with the motor mount  240  through an exterior ring  252 .  FIGS. 27   a ,  27   b ,  27   c  and  27   d  are detail segment views of the fan blades  248 . The fan blades  248  are angled at a constant attack angle across a chord of each blade  248 . In a first embodiment, the attack angle is greater than 20 degrees and less than 40 degrees. 
     Referring now to  FIGS. 28-31 , a preferred embodiment of the homeostatic control system  300  will be described. The homeostatic control system is operably connected to the thrusters to automatically control a thrust produced by each thruster in order to maintain a desired orientation of the saucer. The homeostatic control system includes an XYZ sensor arrangement  302  and associated control circuitry  304  that dynamically determines an inertial gravitational reference for use in automatic control of the thrust produced by each thruster. The control circuitry  304  is preferably implemented in software operating on signals from the XYZ sensor arrangement that have been converted into digital representation by an A/D input port of a microcontroller/microprocessor on which the software is executing. Alternatively, the control circuitry  304  may be implemented as hardware logic, software and processor logic, field programmable gate array (FPGA), application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), firmware or any combination thereof. 
     In this embodiment, the XYZ sensor arrangement comprises an X-axis sensor system, a Y-sensor system and a Z-axis sensor system. The X-axis sensor system is positioned in an X plane of the body and includes at least three first sensors that sense acceleration and gravity in the X plane and at least three second sensors that sense acceleration only in the X plane. The Y-axis sensor system is positioned in an Y plane of the body and includes at least three first sensors that sense acceleration and gravity in the Y plane and at least three second sensors that sense acceleration only in the Y plane. The Z-axis sensor system is positioned in a Z plane of the body and includes at least one sensor that senses yaw in the Z plane. 
     Preferably, the X-axis sensor system comprises two sets of active accelerometers and two sets of passive accelerometers oriented in the X plane. Similarly, the Y-axis sensor system comprises two sets of active accelerometers and two sets of passive accelerometers oriented in the Y plane. In this embodiment, each set of active accelerometers comprises a pair of active accelerometers oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other in the respective plane and each set of passive accelerometers comprises a pair of passive accelerometers oriented at 90 degrees with respect to each other in the respective plane. Each of the pairs of active accelerometers and each of the pairs of passive accelerometers are positioned at 45 degrees offset relative to a horizontal plane through a center of the body. Although the preferred embodiment will be described with respect to four sensors per plane, it will be understood that increasing numbers of sensors per plane could be used to enhance the resolution and accuracy of the homeostatic control system. 
     In this embodiment, the control circuitry includes conditioning circuitry that independently conditions output signals from each accelerometer. The control circuitry also includes differential circuitry that independently operably subtracts output signals from the conditioning circuitry for the passive accelerometers from a corresponding output signal from the conditioning circuitry for the active accelerometers to generate a raw tilt value for each of four corresponding pairs of active and passive accelerometers in each of the X plane and the Y plane. The control circuitry further includes comparison circuitry that compares a ratio of two of the four corresponding pairs of active accelerometers and passive accelerometers with the other two of the four corresponding pairs of active accelerometers and passive accelerometers to determine a ratio of pairs of raw tilt values. An effective angle of an absolute position of the X-axis sensor system in the X plane is determined and an effective angle of an absolute position of the Y-axis sensor system in the Y plane is determined from the ratio of raw tilt values. 
     The control circuitry also includes accumulator circuitry that accumulates the effective angles over time from which an angular rate of change is determined for each of the X plane and the Y plane. A second differential circuitry operably subtracts the ratios of pairs of raw tilt values of each of the X plane and the Y plane from each of the corresponding output signals of the active accelerometers to generate a raw acceleration cross product vector for each of the active accelerometers. The control circuitry then uses processing circuitry that normalizes each of the raw acceleration cross product vectors for each of the active accelerometers in the X plane and the Y plane using the corresponding one of the effective angles for the X plane and the Y plane to generate a normalized cross product vector for each of the active accelerometers. Second comparison circuitry compares a ratio of the normalized cross product vectors of two of the four corresponding pairs of active accelerometers with the normalized cross product vectors of the other two of the four corresponding pairs of active accelerometers to determine a ratio of normalized cross product vectors. An effective magnitude of a true horizontal acceleration and a true vertical acceleration of the X-axis sensor system in the X plane is determined from this ratio of normalized cross product vector. Similarly, an effective magnitude of a true horizontal acceleration and a true vertical acceleration of the Y-axis sensor system in the Y plane is determined from this ratio of normalized cross product vector. 
     The detailed circuit schematic set forth in  FIGS. 30   a - 30   g  detail to a person skilled in the art the implementation of one embodiment of the homeostatic control system. 
     Referring now to  FIGS. 1-3 , an overall view of another embodiment of the present invention of a radio controlled flying hovercraft  10  and the remote controller  12  is shown. Preferably, the hovercraft  10  is of a modular design, with all of the avionics  14 , propulsion  16  and power components  18  being easily replaceable. The remote controller  12  is preferably provided with a thumb-activated throttle and yaw control  20  and one or more finger operated trigger controls  22  and  24 . It is further envisioned that remote controller  12  may incorporate force feedback and/or visual gauges. 
     As illustrated in  FIG. 1 , the hovercraft  10  is an ellipsoid comprised of an upper surface  26  and lower surface  28 . Both upper surface  26  and lower surface  28  are made of Nerf®-like foam material in a preferred embodiment. Alternatively, the body/shell may be made of Styrofoam, arcel, carbon fiber, Kevlar®, plastic or the like. 
     A central housing  30  is disposed within hovercraft  10 . The central housing  30  contains the avionics module  14  and propulsion module  16  modules. In the preferred embodiment, the central housing  30  includes battery pack  32  in the form of rechargeable nickel metal hydride cells. Alternatively, power and even control signals can be provided to the craft via a tether cable (not shown). 
     In one embodiment, the hovercraft  10  is provided with a laser emitter and detector  34  for playing laser tag. LEDs  36  are disposed about the circumference to indicate that the craft has been hit. In alternate embodiments, speakers may also be used. Numerous variations in the tag game can be effected, such as having the craft  10  reduce power and/or stability in response to a hit, exercise a wobble routine in response to a hit, be deactivated after a certain number of hits and automatically land, respond in relation to the relative accuracy of the hit, or even allow for recharging at a base station. 
     As illustrated in  FIG. 2 , the propulsion module  16  is disposed within the central housing  30 . The propulsion module  16  is comprised of four motors  38  operably connected to four matching fans  40  each within a separate duct  42 . The ducted fans  38  are preferably tilted between 10-15 degrees relative to the lower surface  28  of the hovercraft  10  to provide a counter-balanced stabilization effect. A circular airflow is also preferably established between the ducts  42  and the motor housing  44  by way of ventilation passages  46 . The ventilation passages  46  are a plurality of openings located along the common wall  48  adjacent to duct  42  and motor housing  44 . The ventilation passages are located upstream and downstream of the fan  38  so as to induce circulation through the motor housing  44  and around the motors  36  for cooling. However, the majority of the airflow generated by fans  40  is driven through the downstream opening  50  of each duct  42 . 
       FIG. 3  shows a preferred embodiment of a remote controller  12  that provides one-handed control operation with pitch and roll control accomplished by mimicking the pitch and roll of the craft  10  through the use of XY axis transducers in the remote controller  12 . For example, the rotation of the operator&#39;s hand will result in a comparable rotation of the hovercraft  10 . It is envisioned that the remote controller  12  contains batteries, an antenna, and an optional vibration system to signify laser strikes and/or out-of-range operation of the hovercraft  10 . 
     In this embodiment, a 2 digital channel bi-directional controller  12  is preferably used with a transceiver in both the controller and the craft. Preferably, the transceiver operates in the 900 Mhz band, although operation at the 72 Mhz or 400 Mhz bands is also possible. One channel is for digital transmit, the other channel is for digital receive. Preferably, transmissions are done in word packets using 9 bit bytes (8 bits data, 1 bit parity). In one embodiment, a four byte preamble (alternating bytes of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s) and four byte post-amble (alternating bytes of 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s) precede and follow a predetermined length data packet portion of the word packet. The use of a 2 digital channel bi-directional radio frequency (RF) communication scheme permits multi-users to be designated on the same RC channels by using unique ID codes within a header of the data packet portion for a given combination of controller and craft. 
     As illustrated in  FIG. 4   a , the four lift motors  38  and ducted fans  40  are configured symmetrically about the XY axis. Disposed centrally to the four lift motor  38  and ducted fans  40  are the XY axis mercury tilt switch stabilizer transducers  52  of this embodiment.  FIG. 4   b  illustrates the arrangement of the positioning system  54  comprised of XYZ axis piezo gyros  56  also contained within central housing  30 . Each of the three gyros  56  provides angular rate information on the respective x, y and z plane. 
     As illustrated in  FIG. 5 , the four motors  38  are individually connected to a motor speed control  58 . Each motor speed control  58  is operably connected to a common motor enable counter  60 . In preferred a embodiment, the hovercraft  10  is preferably overpowered for normal flight by a lift-to-weight ratio of at least 2:1 and preferably 4:1. This allows the hovercraft  10  to avoid overheating of the four motors  38  and to maximize power and thrust. As illustrated in  FIG. 6 , the switching frequency of the duty cycle is optimized for moment of inertia of the ducted fans  40 . Each motor  38  has a duty cycle staggered relative to the other three motors  38 . 
     In an alternate embodiment that provides for more efficiency, each of the ducted fans  40  has two counter-rotating multi-bladed units. A shaft drive  62  connects the fans to four electric motors  38  mounted within a central housing  30  in the middle of the hovercraft  10 . Preferably, the central housing  30  is provided with EMF shielding around the motors  38 . Since the motor units  38  are overpowered per lift-to-weight ratios, the motors  38  are rotated to maximize cooling and maximize power drain on the battery  32 . 
     As shown in  FIG. 7 , the XY axis tilt switch stabilizer  52  is a fluid suspended tilt switch mechanism. The NSEW transducers  64  represent zero degrees in the XY axis horizontal plane. The transducers  64  are at a (1-3 degree) offset from the set angle. The pairing of the transducers in one plane increases response time and reduces bounce effect of the tilt switch mechanism  52 . Preferably, a simple debouncing circuit accompanies each switch. N′S′E′W′ transducers  66  are set to (5-10 degrees) offset from the zero point to establish predetermined orientations for fly-by-wire XY axis pitch/roll control. It will be recognized that multiple degree sensors could be used to establish a plurality of different fly-by-wire preset orientations. It will also be understood that a variety of different tilt switch or gravity sensors could be used to accomplish a similar effect. 
       FIG. 8  illustrates a block diagram detailing operation onboard the hovercraft  10  of one embodiment of the present invention. A signal interpreter chip  70 , powered by power unit  18  receives inputs from the radio control (R/C) receiver  68  as to directional commands. The R/C receiver  68  is a digital unit capable of receiving the following commands: up, down, yaw left, yaw right, pitch up, pitch down, roll left, roll right, fire laser, engage shields, and other directional and/or operational commands. To implement the commands, signal interpreter chip  70  communicates with XY axis mercury tilt switch transducer  52 , XYZ piezo gyros  56  and any other I/O devices  72 . Once stability and heading are determined by the signal interpreter chip  70 , the motors  38  are engaged by way of speed controllers  58 . Feedback on position is submitted to the remote control unit  12  through R/C transmitter  74 . 
       FIG. 9  is a block diagram illustrating the avionics command system. Radio frequency (R/F) digital carrier signal  76  is decomposed by word isolator  78  into words and then into smaller information packages by byte isolators  80 . The byte packages are then segregated as up/down  82 , pitch  84 , roll,  86  and yaw  88 . The command is converted by the respective voltage processor  90  and resistor circuit  92 , for creation of an appropriate up/down, pitch, roll or yaw velocity vectors. 
       FIG. 10  shows a general configuration of the XY axis mercury tilt switch stabilizer transducer circuit  52  in this embodiment. Roll right (RR)  94  and roll left (RL)  96  are measured by circuit  52 . A counter roll  98  is calculated and converted to the appropriate voltage command  100  and  102 . A similar circuit is used for N′S′E′W′ fly-by-wire roll/pitch settings. 
       FIG. 11  depicts a first embodiment of the stabilizer circuit for the hovercraft  10 . The XY axis mercury tilt switch stabilizer transducers  52  are linked electrically to the appropriate circuit for roll and pitch correction. For example, the N and S transducers  64  provide status information with regard to pitch actuation  104  while the E and W transducers  64  provide status information with regard to roll actuation  106 . 
       FIG. 12  shows a block diagram for enable from the X stabilizer circuit or the Y stabilizer circuit to the piezo gyros  56 .  FIG. 13  shows a schematic diagram of the control system for the motor controllers  58  incorporating the outputs of the stabilizer circuits  52  and the gyro circuits  56 . For example, voltage adder  108  computes inputs from X gyro A , X stab A , Z gyro A , and V u/d . Voltage to frequency converters  110  made up of a 555 timer/op amp circuits convert the combined voltage to a frequency for the respective motor speed controllers  58 .  FIGS. 14-15  show alternate embodiments of the ducted fan blades  40 . 
     In operation, a fly-by-wire signal is sent to the hovercraft  10 . NSEW transducers  64  are sensed and the motors  38  are powered accordingly for the hovercraft  10  to reach zero degrees XY axis. When this point is established, XYZ axis piezo gyros  56  lock on and stabilize the craft  10 . If XY axis drift occurs, the NSEW transducers  64  reengage the process, thereby providing true homeostatic hover control feedback. The remote controller  12  provides digitized command signals which are received by receiver  68 . The signal interpreter chip  70  converts the signal to the appropriate directional and operational command.

     This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 62/057,128, filed on Sep. 29, 2014, and entitled “AN APP STORE FOR STATE MACHINES,” the entirety of which is incorporated herein by reference. 
    
    
     TECHNICAL FIELD 
     This disclosure generally relates to application stores, or app stores, and in particular, to methods and apparatuses for an app store for state machines for products, such as semiconductor devices, for use by persons responsible for product development. 
     BACKGROUND 
     Many electro-mechanical systems, devices, and products include control systems programmed to control their operation according to a predefined control algorithm. For example, systems that include a motor for controlling a position and/or speed of an electro-mechanical component typically include a control system executing a control algorithm that controls operation of the motor according to a defined system operation routine or sequence. These control systems may be implemented in part on semiconductor devices such as microcontrollers or other programmable integrated circuit. 
     Although there are a number of commonalities among control applications of a similar type, control routines differ across different control applications depending on the particular application in which the routine is used. For example, a process for control of a particular type of three-phase induction motor may be a key building block for many types of products that use such motors. However, the program for controlling the motor as an agitator in a washing machine differs from a program for controlling the same motor as a roller in a conveyor system. Despite the commonalities between control routines for various types of products, designers must often develop the control routines for a given product by writing a considerable amount of control code, which may include both common control functionality for a given type of control application as well as custom code particular to the product for which the control code is being written.

     File transfer protocol (FTP) is a network protocol used to transfer or share files between computers of transmission control protocol (TCP) networks such as the Internet. Files transferred or shared in this manner can comprise computer software, such as source code, digital media or applications. Some hosted media stores implement transactions in connection with downloading of content, such that users are charged for downloading certain types of content to an end user&#39;s device (e.g., mobile phone, table computer, laptop computer, desktop computer, etc.). 
     Hosted media stores that facilitate download of applications—referred to as “app stores”—address certain classes of end-user computing devices, and also perform transactions in connection with downloading of apps. Apps can be generally classified according to the type of transaction associated with the download of the app. For example, free apps can be downloaded without charge, paid apps must be purchased by the end user prior to download, and hybrid apps known as “freemium” apps are free to download but include optional upgrade features that are available for purchase. 
     Some app stores implement transactional features of end-user device app stores, but with a focus on lower-level software code. For example, some app stores allow software developers and information technology (IT) professionals to find, transact, and deploy software. 
     In the field of electronic design automation (EDA), and in the semiconductor field in particular, an intellectual property (IP) core or IP block is a unit of logic or data that can be reused in multiple semiconductor designs, typically belonging to one party. Example IP cores or IP blocks include, but are not limited to, processors, memory, input-output connectivity, analog functional blocks, etc. IP cores or IP blocks are categorized as either soft cores or hard cores. Soft cores are provided in a high-level language (e.g., register transfer level language), while hard cores are lower level physical descriptions of a design (e.g., a transistor layout). 
     Some software distribution platforms attempt to make IP cores or IP blocks available through app store functionality. For example, some app stores allow that provide code for developers may allow a semiconductor designer to select from a number of available semi-custom blocks that can be used to build a system-on-chip (SoC) or associated drivers, or facilitate sharing of scripts between developers via the distribution platform. These distribution platforms may offer these IP codes for free, or may require payment of a use price or royalty for each instantiated use. 
     Some app libraries make available verified functions for such applications as motor control, lighting, power supplies, etc. However, such libraries are primarily focused on distribution of lower-level drivers and do nothing to simplify or automate the process of building higher-order applications to instantiate an end product (e.g., a washing machine, a conveyor system, a web tension control system, or other product or system). 
     Some companies license application-specific software for power electronics applications. However, these applications are embedded software that are accessible via an application programming interface (API), and not a graphical user interface (GUI). The software also generally requires an engineer to customize the software separately from the development work performed by other engineers responsible for product development at the customer or licensee end. According to this model, certain application blocks are customized rather than being reused and modified in an app store environment. 
     Control systems typically include devices that translate electrical signals to facilitate mechanical control or actuation of a physical process in a product or system. Given the low cost and ubiquity of semiconductor devices, the electrical signals are often provided by one or more microcontrollers or other programmable integrated circuits to achieve this mechanical control. There are a number of challenges associated with the use of semiconductor microcontrollers for control of products or product components. For one, semiconductor microcontrollers made by different companies do not share a common language. For example, the 8051 instruction set is used by some device, while Intel Corporation&#39;s x86 instruction set and ARM Holdings instruction set are used on other devices. Some microcontrollers also use proprietary instruction sets developed by their respective providers. Microcontrollers can also be provided as an IP core or IP block for a field-programmable gate array (FPGA) device. Although there are compilers for each of these platforms that can work with a higher-level language such as the C programming language, there are also design considerations in the product development context that require one to be close to the hardware to effect electro-mechanical control or actuation. 
     In addition, applications differ across the product development context. For example, a system for controlling a particular type of three-phase induction motor may be a key building block in many types of industrial applications. However, programs for using that motor as an agitator in a washing machine may differ from programs that control the motor when used as a roller in a conveyor. As such, an app store that caters to the needs of such control applications should consider both reusable building blocks such as the induction motor controller, while providing adaptability to accommodate different end-user applications (e.g., washing machine application, conveyor belt application, etc.). For a seamless experience, both the lower-level building blocks (e.g., the induction motor controller) and the higher-order application capability (e.g., washing machine versus conveyor belt) require abstraction. If only the lower-level building block is provided, then applications will be difficult to create. If only the higher-order application is offered, then the application will not run, or will run only on targeted hosts. 
     To address these and other issues, and to extend app stores to persons responsible for product development, one or more embodiments of this disclosure re-envision the concept of the app store for state machines. In general, an app store according to one or more embodiments described herein includes a plurality of apps representing state machines that describe the function of a product. A user can select at least one app from this plurality of apps. An intermediate step may permit a user to customize the state machine, or parameters thereof. Another intermediate step may allow the user to identify a target platform and further translate the state machine into a format readable by a semiconductor device in the target platform without requiring the user to write computer code. This step may fuse a lower-level building block with a higher-order application represented by the state machine. Another intermediate step may transact rights to use the app representing the state machine. When the app-specific code is installed on a semiconductor device, the semiconductor device with app-specific code is enabled to execute the state machine. In one or more embodiments, the state machine may also be executed in a simulation environment, on a reference platform or development board, or on a semiconductor device in an end-user product. 
     In an example embodiment, the system can be used to select and customize an app for execution on a microcontroller to facilitate control of a motor control system. In an example scenario, the motor control application can be for control of an agitator in a washing machine. A state machine can represent the washing machine cycle (e.g., soak, wash, dry, etc.). According to one or more embodiments, the app store platform allows the user to select an app representing the state machine, optionally customize the state machine represented by the app, and install the app on the microcontroller. Thus, the system enables the user to create an out-of-box solution for a washing machine motor controller, mitigating the need to develop custom code. In another example scenario, the motor control application may be for control of a conveyor belt. In this example, a state machine represents the conveyor belt cycle (e.g., wait, move, etc.). This alternative state machine may be selected by the user to create an out-of-box solution for conveyor belt control using the same underlying microcontroller and lower-level building blocks (or a different microcontroller using different lower-level building blocks) and without requiring the end user to develop custom code. 
     In this way, persons responsible for product development enjoy the benefits of an app store. For example, development time can be reduced by leveraging the apps made available by the app store, since designers do not need to write code or understand the intricacies of the microcontroller core used for the control application. By abstracting code development, the app store system can also reduce switching costs between microcontrollers. The flexibility offered by the app store can allow a project team to support multiple microcontrollers, or switch between microcontroller vendors if dictated by business needs. The app store also allows applications to be shared within a user community, and facilitates continuous improvement of a database of state machines for products and control systems. 
       FIG. 1  is a depiction of a state machine for a washing machine app. In particular, the state machine depicted in  FIG. 1  is an example state machine implemented by a Texas Instruments microcontroller. The format shows the state machine as a finite state representation of a Turing machine. The first block or initialization state  100  is the dry state. In this state, the washing machine is empty of water and ready for a new cycle. Control then transfers to the idle state  110 , which waits for a user to push a start button to begin a cycle. When the start button is pushed, control moves to the fill state  120 , during which the fill valve is opened and the washing machine drum is filled with water. Control logically follows with additional states for multiple agitation cycles and a drain cycle, as shown in  FIG. 1 . 
       FIG. 2  is a depiction of an alternative state machine for a washing machine app. In particular,  FIG. 2  depicts an example control algorithm from LG. In contrast to the state machine format of  FIG. 1 , this format is not a finite state representation of a Turning machine. Instead,  FIG. 2  depicts the state machine in a Cartesian coordinate system in two dimensions (on an x-y graph) showing time  210  as the abscissa (or x-axis) and rotations per minute (RPM)  220  of the motor rotating the washing machine drum as the ordinate (or y-axis). The state machine can be depicted in this format since the washing machine app progresses through states in a linear fashion (soak, wash, dry, etc.). A number of formats can be used to represent the state machine, including finite state representations of a Turing machine, Cartesian coordinate systems, tables, flowcharts, etc. In general, the state machine presents a visual representation for operation of a product, device, or machine that has at least two states. 
     A product illustratively refers to products or components of products for use in consumer markets (e.g., a washing machine or its agitator, a microwave oven or its electromagnetic heating element, a refrigerator or its compressor, etc.), industrial markets (a conveyor or its belt system, a refrigerator or its heating element, a refinery or its fluid-level control system), automotive and aerospace markets (anti-lock braking systems, turbo-chargers for engines, electronic fuel injection), energy markets (a solar system or its regulation a wind turbine or its gearing and generator, drilling equipment, etc.), medical devices (coil positioners in an MRI machine, pulse creation in a pacemaker, IV drip control, etc.), robotics (UAV stability, manipulator arm control, artificial limbs, etc.), wireless devices, the Internet of Things, etc. This list of product types is not intended to be exclusive, and it is to be appreciated that other types of products are also within the scope of one or more embodiments of this disclosure. 
       FIG. 3  is a block diagram of an app store for state machines. According to the example embodiment depicted in  FIG. 3 , the app store environment comprises three devices, including server computer  300 , client computer  340 , and target platform  370 . Server computer  300  is in communication with client computer  340  through any of a number of client-server configurations both locally or remotely hosted. Client computer  340  is in communication with target platform  370  through any of a number of protocols, including wired protocols such as JTAG or wireless protocols such as Bluetooth, WiFi, or Zigbbee. It is to be appreciated that some embodiments of the app store environment do not require all three of the main devices illustrated in  FIG. 3 , and that any of the three components can be omitted without departing from the scope of one or more embodiments described herein. For example, alternative embodiments could remove client computer  340  and work directly from server  300  to target platform  370 , or be locally hosted on client computer  340  without the use of server computer  300 . 
     Server computer  300  can be any computer system as generally understood by those of ordinary skill in the art. Server computer  300  will typically include three elements to enable an app store for state machines. A plurality of state machines  310  are stored in a storage area of the server computer  300  and made available for selection by a user. The server computer renders the plurality of state machines  310  visible to an end user, either directly or via user interface  350  of client computer  340 . In one or more embodiments, an interface component executing on the server computer can generate and deliver a GUI to the client computer  340  that can be used to interact with the app store for state machines. The GUI can display the available state machines on the user interface  350  of the client device, and can also include input sections for receiving state machine selection criteria from the user. 
     Visibility into the plurality of state machines  310  may take different forms. For example, the interface component executing on the server computer  300  may render the plurality of state machines  310  as a list via user interface  350 . The system may group categories of state machines together according to application (e.g., washing machine), according to supported vendor (e.g., Texas Instruments microcontroller), or according to other categories. The GUI served by the interface component of the server computer  300  can also provide a means to search for particular state machines. In one or more embodiments, the GUI can accept search criteria comprising key words, or may support a specific search capability to identify state machines by application (e.g., washing machine) or by supported vendor (e.g., Texas Instruments microcontroller). In response to receipt of search or selection criteria, a selection component executing on server computer  300  can select a subset of the plurality of state machines  310  that satisfy the search or selection criteria entered by the user, and either deliver the subset to the client device as a displayed list or other graphical representation for review and further selection by the user, or initiate a download of the subset of state machines to the client computer  340 . A selected state machine app can display, on the user interface  350 , a visual representation of the state machine represented by the app, where the state machine is designed for operation of a product that has at least two states (e.g., a washing machine, a conveyor, etc). 
     At least one lower-level building block  320  is available as part of the app store for state machines. To enable the generation of an end-user product without the requiring the end user to write new code, the system can make lower-level building block  320  available to the user while hiding its details from the user unless the user requests to view the underlying code of the building block  320 . Thus, in one or more embodiments, the lower-level building block  320  is located on server computer  300  and is not directly visible to the user through user interface  350 . In alternative embodiments, lower-level building block  320  can be stored on client computer  340 , or the system can allow a user to access and modify computer code, routings, and other parameters of the lower-level building block. 
     Lower-level building block  320  comprises computer code, routings, and other parameters that will be bound with a state machine application (or app) to create or control a product. A lower-level building block can be associated with a particular microcontroller and/or other specific hardware. For example, the lower-level building block may be associated with a particular pin-out of the microcontroller, a motor selected for an application, or a reference board layout. The lower-level building block may be written in language close to silicon, such as register transfer language (RTL) or VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL). The lower-level building block may comprise machine language executable code for the device, or an intermediate code that can be compiled such as C. The lower-level building block describes an operation (an induction motor controller) rather than a higher-order application (e.g., a washing machine or conveyor belt). The lower-level building block  320  provides context for the state machine  310  to generate code  360  that executes on target platform  370  to enable the end-user product. 
     Transaction engine  330  is optionally included as part of the app store for state machines in one or more embodiments. Transaction engine  330  provides a mechanism for a user to acquire license rights to apps. In some embodiments, apps are free and provided using an open-source licensing model. In other embodiments, state machines and lower-level building blocks are separately licensed. State machines may be transacted on a freemium basis; that is, free to download but with the option of paid upgrades, such as the unlocking of additional features, customization tools, or increased license counts. Revenue models can use flat fees for unlimited use licenses, per use license fees, or other arrangements for charging an end user. The transaction model may include a use price for the design and royalty for each instantiated use. 
     The use of server computer  300  and the client-server computer model allows the app store for state machines to be available to a user community. A user community may include a global group, a set of users of a particular semiconductor device, a set of persons employed by a particular company, a set of persons within an engineering team, or other such groups. The user community may be defined by other boundaries not listed above, provided that at least two state machines  310  are made available by the app store and at least two users are part of the user community. Each user can use a separate client computer  340  to log onto server computer  300  and access the app store for state machines (e.g., via a wireless connection to a remote network such as the Internet, via a local wired or wireless network, etc.). Transaction engine  330  may be configured in light of the user community, using permissions or other credentials to authorize licensing of state machines  310  and related lower-level building blocks  320 . 
     Client computer  340  can be substantially any computer system. For example, client computer  340  may be a mobile computing device, such as a laptop computer, a tablet computer, a desktop computer, a mobile phone or similar handset, etc. Client computer  340  will typically include a graphical user interface (GUI) for accessing the app store for state machines. In one or more embodiments, the GUI may be served to the client computer  340  by the server computer  300 . Alternatively, the GUI may comprise an executable that resides locally on client computer  340 , such that execution of the GUI causes the client computer  340  to connect to the server computer  300  for access to the library of state machines  310 . Client computer  340  may be a thin client or a thick client. A thin-client architecture is designed to be small so that the bulk of the data processing occurs on the server computer  300 . A thick-client architecture entails processing mainly on client computer  340 . In an example thick-client architecture, server computer  300  may only be used for file storage as a cloud repository for state machines for apps. 
     Target platform  370  may be a product, a component of a product, a development environment, or a simulation environment for creating the product or component. In the washing machine example, target platform  370  can be the washing machine (a product), the motor for spinning the drum (a component of a product), or a development board from a semiconductor manufacturer for a microcontroller used in washing machine control (a development environment). Target platform  370  will include at least one semiconductor device  380  and may include electro-mechanical element  390 . In the washing machine example, semiconductor device  380  may be a microcontroller from Texas Instruments or another manufacturer, and electro-mechanical element  390  may be a motor or motor assembly for rotating the drum of the washing machine. 
     Semiconductor device  380  will typically be a microcontroller, a small computer on an integrated circuit designed for embedded applications. Semiconductor device  380  may also be an FPGA, either as a completely programmable core or as a hybrid device that includes a microcontroller plus programmable logic. 
     The product to which state machine  310  is directed may include electro-mechanical element  390 . Electro-mechanical element  390  receives signals from semiconductor device  380 , and translates or transduces those signals to effect a physical or mechanical change. In the example washing machine scenario, the electro-mechanical element is the motor and the drum driven by the motor. In the example conveyor belt scenario, the electro-mechanical element is the motor and the rollers driven by the motor. Electro-mechanical element  390  may also comprise an electro-optical system, an electro-magnetic system, one or more sensors, or other systems that produce or measure a physical effect. 
     Code  360  includes computer code that can be used by target platform  370  to produce signals to drive semiconductor device  380 . In various embodiments, code  360  can be generated on server computer  300  or client computer  340 . Code  360  includes sufficient capability to implement state machine  310  and lower-level building block  320  so that semiconductor device  380  can control and actuate electro-mechanical element  390  according to the state machine selected for the target platform. Code  360  may include low-level code, such as object code directly usable by semiconductor device  380 , or may include code that can be compiled or interpreted by additional software modules for use by semiconductor device  380 . 
       FIG. 4  is a flow chart of a method for an app store for state machines. While the flow chart of  FIG. 4  is depicted as comprising seven steps, some embodiments may not require all seven steps to perform the method for an app store for state machines. Rather, a subset of the illustrated steps can be used. For example, the steps of customizing the state machine  420  and transacting the app acquisition  450  are optional steps. It is also to be understood that the order of operation of certain steps does not have to conform to the order shown in  FIG. 4 . For example, it is possible to perform step  450  (transact the app acquisition) at any point in the process—from inception through a final step after code has been downloaded and verified. 
     Initially, at step  400 , an app store is presented. Step  400  will typically be associated with client computer  340  and a user interface as discussed below in connection with  FIG. 6 . At step  410 , a state machine is selected for a product by a user. As previously discussed, a list of state machines may be displayed on the user&#39;s client device, and a state machine may be selected via interaction with the presented list. To assist the user in locating a desired state machine, categories of state machines may be grouped together by application (e.g., washing machine, conveyor, etc.), by supported vendor (e.g., Texas Instruments), or by one or more other categories. The app store can also implement a means to search for particular state machines. This can include keyword searches, or the ability to identify specific state machines for selection according to application (e.g., washing machine, conveyor etc.), supported vendor, or another category. A selected state machine can provide a visual representation for operation of a product that has at least two states. 
     At step  420 , the state machine is optionally customized. In this regard, the system may include an editing component that allows the user to customize all or a specified subset of features of the selected state machine. In the washing machine example, the editing component may allow a user to adjust, insert, or delete agitation states (e.g., agitation state  130  of  FIG. 1 ); e.g., via interaction with the state machine representation displayed on the user interface  350 . The editing component may also allow the user to alter the time  210  or motor speed  220  for a particular portion of the cycle. Other adjustments to the selected state machine could also be made. In one or more embodiments, if a state machine for a particular type of application—e.g., a washing machine—is selected, the system can provide a template of a washing machine cycle, and variants yielded by user modification could be created and saved as separate or related state machines. For example, the system can allow the creation of variants of the washing machine state machine for regular wash, heavy-duty wash, and delicate wash, where each variant has an appropriately modified set of parameters to implement the correct type of wash cycle. 
     The two-dimensional state machine of  FIG. 2  could be a three-dimensional state machine wherein the third dimension controls water temperature and the related electro-mechanical functions for blending hot water and cold water inputs. In the washing machine example, motor control could be accomplished using active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) or classic proportional-integral-derivative control (PID control). The variables into these control systems can also be adjusted. 
     A series of steps are then followed to enable the target device. At step  430 , the state machine is bound to a target platform. This step allows a user to select a target platform on which t to execute the state machine representing the app. Step  430  may involve the selection of a particular microcontroller that comprises semiconductor device  380 . However, step  430  may be omitted in systems that are platform-specific or limited to certain platforms. With the selection of the state machine in step  410  and knowledge of the target platform either inherently or through step  430 , application code is generated at step  440 . The code from this step is equivalent to code  360 , which will be influenced by high-level properties of the application and low-level properties of the target platform including its semiconductor device  380 . After the code is created at step  440 , the code is downloaded to the target device  460 . 
     At step  450 , the app acquisition is optionally transacted. This involves the licensing of the state machine for the product. As discussed above in connection with the transaction engine  330 , in some scenarios the system can provide apps for free using an open-source model. The system may also license state machines and lower-level building blocks separately. State machine apps may also be transacted on a freemium basis, such that the apps are free to download and have paid upgrade options that unlock additional features such as customization tools or increase license counts. In some embodiments, the system can implement revenue models that use flat fees for unlimited use licenses, per use license fees, or other arrangements for charging an end user. The transaction model may include a use price for the design and royalty for each instantiated use. 
       FIGS. 5-7  illustrate an embodiment of the app store for state machines in which the target platform includes a motor.  FIG. 5  is a block diagram of a portion of an app store for state machines in which the target platform includes a motor. Computer  510  with PC GUI is similar to client computer  340  with user interface  350 . There are additional initialization steps involved with the motor application discussed in  FIG. 6 . Memory  520  and motor  270  are similar to target platform  370 . The processing elements of semiconductor device  380  as well as server computer  300  and its components are not shown in  FIG. 5 , but would typically be implemented. Motor  570  is a form of electro-mechanical element  390 . 
     Memory  520  in the motor example is a microcontroller flash, typically as part of a microcontroller, but may also be implemented as a separate memory chip. In the motor example, memory  520  comprises at least four elements. Motor control code  530  comprises fundamental software routines to activate the motor (on, off, spin, etc.). Motion control code  540  comprises complex software routines to control the quality of the motor (acceleration, deceleration, jerk, etc.). Flash loader  550  comprises software to enable downloading of software into memory  520 , as discussed above in connection with step  460  of  FIG. 4 . Motor application code  560  comprises software that executes the state machine for the higher-order application (washing machine, conveyor belt, etc.). In this example, code  360  is stored as separate modules: lower-level building blocks (e.g. lower-level building blocks  320 ) in memories associated with motor control code  530  and motion control code  540 , and the state machine (e.g., from the plurality of state machines  310 ) in memory associated with motor application code  560 . 
       FIG. 6  is a flow chart of a method for an app store for state machines in which the target platform includes a motor. Three of these steps are similar to corresponding steps in the method shown in  FIG. 4 . The step of accessing code for desired motor  630  is similar to the step of selecting the state machine  420 . The step of tweaking the application state machine  640  is similar to the step of customizing the state machine  420 . The step of flashing the application to reserved memory on chip  650  is one form of the step of downloading to a target device  460 . 
     In the embodiment depicted in  FIG. 6 , certain steps from the general method shown in  FIG. 4  are implicit, handled in an alternate fashion, or not included. The step of presenting the app store in a GUI  400  is implicit in the initialization sequences discussed below in steps  610  and  620 . The steps of binding with the target platform  430  and creating app code  440  are at least in part handled at run time in the example depicted in  FIG. 6 . As discussed above with regard to memory  520 , there are separate areas to store lower-level building blocks (in  530  and  540 ) and the state machine (in  560 ). The step of transacting app acquisition  450  is not shown in  FIG. 6 , and as discussed above in connection with  FIG. 4 , the is an optional step in one or more embodiments. 
     Computer  510  and steps  610  and  620  describe initialization that is part of the motor example. The step of measuring the motor  610  reads the parameters of the motor  570  to identify the motor and to determine what motor control code  530  and related parameters should be used. The step of tuning the motion controller  620  optimizes the motion control of motor  570  so that the motor functions smoothly and to determine what motion control code  540  and related parameters should be used. For example, motor control could be accomplished using active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) or classic proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control. The variables into these control systems could also be adjusted during step  620  and stored in memory associated with motion control code  540 . Step  660  is an additional step in the motor example where the system is fine-tuned. This may entail further changes to memory  520 . 
       FIG. 7  is an example, non-limiting graphical user interface (GUI) for the present invention in which the target platform includes a motor. This is one of a plurality of screens that may be used in the motor example. In other embodiments, all content could be displayed on a single screen. Step  710  is parallel to step  610  and involves the identification of the motor. Steps  710  and  720  are parallel to step  620  an involve tuning of the motion controller for the motor.  FIG. 7  focuses specifically on step  720 —speed profile control, which is an element of motor control. Step  730  is parallel to step  630  and involves selection of the state machine. Step  730  further suggests an alternative embodiment in which the state machine is developed, which may be accomplished via interaction with the GUI. Area  740  shows a visual representation of speed profile control parameters for a motor. On other screens, area  740  could show a visual representation of a selected state machine, similar to  FIG. 1  or  FIG. 2 . 
     Other alternative embodiments may include different initialization steps, alternative configurations, or other elements that deviate from the general example of an app store for state machines shown in  FIGS. 3 and 4  and the motor example shown in  FIGS. 5-7 . Other forms of electro-mechanical element  390  other than motor  570  could also be used. The foregoing description is only intended to be illustrative and should not be construed as limiting.

     Each computing object  810 ,  812 , etc. and computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc. can communicate with one or more other computing objects  810 ,  812 , etc. and computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc. by way of the communications network  840 , either directly or indirectly. Even though illustrated as a single element in  FIG. 8 , communications network  840  may comprise other computing objects and computing devices that provide services to the system of  FIG. 8 , and/or may represent multiple interconnected networks, which are not shown.

     There are a variety of systems, components, and network configurations that support distributed computing environments. For example, computing systems can be connected together by wired or wireless systems, by local networks or widely distributed networks. Currently, many networks are coupled to the Internet, which provides an infrastructure for widely distributed computing and encompasses many different networks, though any suitable network infrastructure can be used for exemplary communications made incident to the systems as described in various embodiments herein. 
     Thus, a host of network topologies and network infrastructures, such as client/server, peer-to-peer, or hybrid architectures, can be utilized. The “client” is a member of a class or group that uses the services of another class or group. A client can be a computer process, e.g., roughly a set of instructions or tasks, that requests a service provided by another program or process. A client process may utilize the requested service without having to “know” all working details about the other program or the service itself. 
     In a client/server architecture, particularly a networked system, a client can be a computer that accesses shared network resources provided by another computer, e.g., a server. In the illustration of  FIG. 8 , as a non-limiting example, computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc. can be thought of as clients and computing objects  810 ,  812 , etc. can be thought of as servers where computing objects  810 ,  812 , etc. provide data services, such as receiving data from client computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc., storing of data, processing of data, transmitting data to client computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc., although any computer can be considered a client, a server, or both, depending on the circumstances. Any of these computing devices may be processing data, or requesting transaction services or tasks that may implicate the techniques for systems as described herein for one or more embodiments. 
     A server is typically a remote computer system accessible over a remote or local network, such as the Internet or wireless network infrastructures. The client process may be active in a first computer system, and the server process may be active in a second computer system, communicating with one another over a communications medium, thus providing distributed functionality and allowing multiple clients to take advantage of the information-gathering capabilities of the server. Any software objects utilized pursuant to the techniques described herein can be provided standalone, or distributed across multiple computing devices or objects. 
     In a network environment in which the communications network  840  is the Internet, for example, the computing objects  810 ,  812 , etc. can be Web servers, file servers, media servers, etc. with which the client computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc. communicate via any of a number of known protocols, such as the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). Computing objects  810 ,  812 , etc. may also serve as client computing objects or devices  820 ,  822 ,  824 ,  826 ,  828 , etc., as may be characteristic of a distributed computing environment.

     Although not required, embodiments can partly be implemented via an operating system, for use by a developer of services for a device or object, and/or included within application software that operates to perform one or more functional aspects of the various embodiments described herein. Software may be described in the general context of computer executable instructions, such as program modules, being executed by one or more computers, such as client workstations, servers or other devices. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that computer systems have a variety of configurations and protocols that can be used to communicate data, and thus, no particular configuration or protocol is to be considered limiting.

Neither is the computing system environment  900  be interpreted as having any dependency or requirement relating to any one or combination of components illustrated in the exemplary computing system environment  900 . 
     With reference to  FIG. 9 , an exemplary computing device for implementing one or more embodiments in the form of a computer  910  is depicted. Components of computer  910  may include, but are not limited to, a processing unit  920 , a system memory  930 , and a system bus  922  that couples various system components including the system memory to the processing unit  920 . 
     Computer  910  typically includes a variety of computer readable media and can be any available media that can be accessed by computer  910 . The system memory  930  may include computer storage media in the form of volatile and/or nonvolatile memory such as read only memory (ROM) and/or random access memory (RAM). By way of example, and not limitation, system memory  930  may also include an operating system, application programs, other program modules, and program data. 
     A user can enter commands and information into the computer  910  through input devices  940 , non-limiting examples of which can include a keyboard, keypad, a pointing device, a mouse, stylus, touchpad, touchscreen, trackball, motion detector, camera, microphone, joystick, game pad, scanner, or any other device that allows the user to interact with computer  910 .

In addition to a monitor, computers can also include other peripheral output devices such as speakers and a printer, which may be connected through output interface  950 . In one or more embodiments, input devices  940  can provide user input to user interface  350 , while output interface  950  can correspond to user interface  350 . 
     The computer  910  may operate in a networked or distributed environment using logical connections to one or more other remote computers, such as remote computer  970 . The remote computer  970  may be a personal computer, a server, a router, a network PC, a peer device or other common network node, or any other remote media consumption or transmission device, and may include any or all of the elements described above relative to the computer  910 . The logical connections depicted in  FIG. 9  include a network  972 , such local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), but may also include other networks/buses e.g., cellular networks. 
     As mentioned above, while exemplary embodiments have been described in connection with various computing devices and network architectures, the underlying concepts may be applied to any network system and any computing device or system in which it is desirable to publish or consume media in a flexible way. 
     Also, there are multiple ways to implement the same or similar functionality, e.g., an appropriate API, tool kit, driver code, operating system, control, standalone or downloadable software object, etc. which enables applications and services to take advantage of the techniques described herein. Thus, embodiments herein are contemplated from the standpoint of an API (or other software object), as well as from a software or hardware object that implements one or more aspects described herein. Thus, various embodiments described herein can have aspects that are wholly in hardware, partly in hardware and partly in software, as well as in software. 
     The word “exemplary” is used herein to mean serving as an example, instance, or illustration. For the avoidance of doubt, the aspects disclosed herein are not limited by such examples. In addition, any aspect or design described herein as “exemplary” is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other aspects or designs, nor is it meant to preclude equivalent exemplary structures and techniques known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Furthermore, to the extent that the terms “includes,” “has,” “contains,” and other similar words are used in either the detailed description or the claims, for the avoidance of doubt, such terms are intended to be inclusive in a manner similar to the term “comprising” as an open transition word without precluding any additional or other elements. 
     Computing devices typically include a variety of media, which can include computer-readable storage media and/or communications media, in which these two terms are used herein differently from one another as follows. Computer-readable storage media can be any available storage media that can be accessed by the computer, is typically of a non-transitory nature, and can include both volatile and nonvolatile media, removable and non-removable media. By way of example, and not limitation, computer-readable storage media can be implemented in connection with any method or technology for storage of information such as computer-readable instructions, program modules, structured data, or unstructured data. Computer-readable storage media can include, but are not limited to, RAM, ROM, EEPROM, flash memory or other memory technology, CD-ROM, digital versatile disk (DVD) or other optical disk storage, magnetic cassettes, magnetic tape, magnetic disk storage or other magnetic storage devices, or other tangible and/or non-transitory media which can be used to store desired information. Computer-readable storage media can be accessed by one or more local or remote computing devices, e.g., via access requests, queries or other data retrieval protocols, for a variety of operations with respect to the information stored by the medium. 
     On the other hand, communications media typically embody computer-readable instructions, data structures, program modules or other structured or unstructured data in a data signal such as a modulated data signal, e.g., a carrier wave or other transport mechanism, and includes any information delivery or transport media. The term “modulated data signal” or signals refers to a signal that has one or more of its characteristics set or changed in such a manner as to encode information in one or more signals. By way of example, and not limitation, communication media include wired media, such as a wired network or direct-wired connection, and wireless media such as acoustic, RF, infrared and other wireless media. 
     As mentioned, the various techniques described herein may be implemented in connection with hardware or software or, where appropriate, with a combination of both. As used herein, the terms “component,” “system” and the like are likewise intended to refer to a computer-related entity, either hardware, a combination of hardware and software, software, or software in execution. For example, a component may be, but is not limited to being, a process running on a processor, a processor, an object, an executable, a thread of execution, a program, and/or a computer. By way of illustration, both an application running on computer and the computer can be a component. One or more components may reside within a process and/or thread of execution and a component may be localized on one computer and/or distributed between two or more computers. Further, a “device” can come in the form of specially designed hardware; generalized hardware made specialized by the execution of software thereon that enables the hardware to perform specific function (e.g., coding and/or decoding); software stored on a computer readable medium; or a combination thereof. 
     The aforementioned systems have been described with respect to interaction between several components. It can be appreciated that such systems and components can include those components or specified sub-components, some of the specified components or sub-components, and/or additional components, and according to various permutations and combinations of the foregoing. Sub-components can also be implemented as components communicatively coupled to other components rather than included within parent components (hierarchical). Additionally, it is to be noted that one or more components may be combined into a single component providing aggregate functionality or divided into several separate sub-components, and that any one or more middle layers, such as a management layer, may be provided to communicatively couple to such sub-components in order to provide integrated functionality. Any components described herein may also interact with one or more other components not specifically described herein but generally known by those of skill in the art. 
     In order to provide for or aid in the numerous inferences described herein, components described herein can examine the entirety or a subset of the data to which it is granted access and can provide for reasoning about or infer states of the system, environment, etc. from a set of observations as captured via events and/or data. Inference can be employed to identify a specific context or action, or can generate a probability distribution over states, for example. The inference can be probabilistic—that is, the computation of a probability distribution over states of interest based on a consideration of data and events. Inference can also refer to techniques employed for composing higher-level events from a set of events and/or data. 
     Such inference can result in the construction of new events or actions from a set of observed events and/or stored event data, whether or not the events are correlated in close temporal proximity, and whether the events and data come from one or several event and data sources. Various classification (explicitly and/or implicitly trained) schemes and/or systems (e.g., support vector machines, neural networks, expert systems, Bayesian belief networks, fuzzy logic, data fusion engines, etc.) can be employed in connection with performing automatic and/or inferred action in connection with the claimed subject matter. 
     A classifier can map an input attribute vector, x=(x1, x2, x3, x4, xn), to a confidence that the input belongs to a class, as by f(x)=confidence(class). Such classification can employ a probabilistic and/or statistical-based analysis (e.g., factoring into the analysis utilities and costs) to prognose or infer an action that a user desires to be automatically performed. A support vector machine (SVM) is an example of a classifier that can be employed. The SVM operates by finding a hyper-surface in the space of possible inputs, where the hyper-surface attempts to split the triggering criteria from the non-triggering events. Intuitively, this makes the classification correct for testing data that is near, but not identical to training data. Other directed and undirected model classification approaches include, e.g., naïve Bayes, Bayesian networks, decision trees, neural networks, fuzzy logic models, and probabilistic classification models providing different patterns of independence can be employed. Classification as used herein also is inclusive of statistical regression that is utilized to develop models of priority. 
     In view of the exemplary systems described above, methodologies that may be implemented in accordance with the described subject matter will be better appreciated with reference to the flowcharts of the various figures (e.g.,  FIGS. 4 and 6 ). While for purposes of simplicity of explanation, the methodologies are shown and described as a series of blocks, it is to be understood and appreciated that the claimed subject matter is not limited by the order of the blocks, as some blocks may occur in different orders and/or concurrently with other blocks from what is depicted and described herein. Where non-sequential, or branched, flow is illustrated via flowchart, it can be appreciated that various other branches, flow paths, and orders of the blocks, may be implemented which achieve the same or a similar result. Moreover, not all illustrated blocks may be required to implement the methodologies described hereinafter. 
     In addition to the various embodiments described herein, it is to be understood that other similar embodiments can be used or modifications and additions can be made to the described embodiment(s) for performing the same or equivalent function of the corresponding embodiment(s) without deviating there from. Still further, multiple processing chips or multiple devices can share the performance of one or more functions described herein, and similarly, storage can be effected across a plurality of devices. Accordingly, the invention is not to be limited to any single embodiment, but rather can be construed in breadth, spirit and scope in accordance with the appended claims.","What is claimed is:

US-2015281222-A1,"A Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) validator is interposed between a principal and a network service. The validator interacts with a mobile application (app) on the mobile device associated with the principal to dynamically supply a validator secret. The secret and, perhaps, other information are processed by the app to generate a TOTP when the principal attempts to access a protected resource of the network service. The validator independently generates the TOTP and compares the app generated TOTP, and on a successful match, a principal&#39;s access device is redirected for access to the protected resource.","BACKGROUND 
     Many companies are using multifactor authentication to provide a higher level of security to the services that they are providing. A common technique is to issue a token device that is used to generate a 4-6 digit code, based on the “Time Of Day” (TOD) and an internal algorithm with a secret key. This 4-6 digit code changes every few minutes and is input by the user, when prompted after he/she has input his/her name and password or some other form of authentication. Before the token device can be used, a device-specific secret key is registered with the server for each user, and may be kept on a server as part of the user&#39;s identity. Each new device requires that a new entry is added to the data store for the user. Each user has a unique entry for each device, which is stored on the authenticating server&#39;s data storage. Many times this is done as part of the user&#39;s identity store such as Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) store, but can also be a separate data store. These token devices can be small hardware devices that can be stored on a user&#39;s key chain, such that the user can look at a small display and read the Time-based One Time Password (TOTP) each time he/she needs to enter his/her TOTP value. Smart mobile devices with custom applications are starting to replace the hardware-based tokens by generating the time-based tokens for the user. 
     The technique of providing a one-time password word works fine when the user has an identity that is stored in a directory that can be updated with the device-specific key. The problem comes when there is not a writeable-user object or no user object at all, for a user wishing to use a TOTP approach. This has not been a real issue in the past because there has been a user object that was used to validate the password or other credentials. 
     Social networks have changed the landscape, by providing a simple single-sign on technique of authenticating to a service without a user store at the service. The service uses the identity data from a social service such as Facebook®, and keeps nothing else. The problem is that the service may need or may want more validation than Facebook® can provide. To use TOTP, the service needs to store a secret for each token device that is registered, even if there is not an account for the end user at the service. This new data storage requirement adds a cost to the service, which can be from 10 cents to $1 per year for each user. With accessed systems of social networks there is the potential of tens of thousands, hundreds of millions, or even billions of users. This can add a large recurring cost to the service for the extra security. With the use of mobile devices as the token device, the cost of the token devices becomes low or zero, but there is a cost of keeping the device key at the service (and each user may have multiple devices). In large environments were servers must be clustered, the cost of keeping a shared and fault tolerant database can be very high. 
     SUMMARY 
     Various embodiments of the invention provide techniques for Time-based One Time Passwords (TOTPs) for network authentication. In an embodiment, a method for handing a TOTP of a network service is presented. 
     Specifically, a token is received and validated. Next, a login by a principal to a network service is detected. A unique identity, supplied by the network service to the principal after a successful login, is obtained. Next, a TOTP secret is generated based at least in part on the unique identity and a secret. Finally, the TOTP secret is provided to a mobile application of a mobile device associated with the principal for authentication when the principal attempts to access a protected resource of the network service, and the TOTP secret is removed from the server once provided to the mobile application.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     A “resource” includes a user, service, system, device, directory, data store, groups of users, files, combinations and/or collections of these things, etc. A “principal” is a specific type of resource, such as an automated service or user that at one time or another is an actor on another principal or another type of resource. A designation as to what is a resource and what is a principal can change depending upon the context of any given network transaction. Thus, if one resource attempts to access another resource, the actor of the transaction may be viewed as a principal. Resources can acquire and be associated with unique identities to identify unique resources during network transactions. 
     An “identity” is something that is formulated from one or more identifiers and secrets that provide a statement of roles and/or permissions that the identity has in relation to resources. An “identifier” is information, which may be private and permits an identity to be formed, and some portions of an identifier may be public information, such as a user identifier, name, etc. Some examples of identifiers include social security number (SSN), user identifier and password pair, account number, retina scan, fingerprint, face scan, etc. 
     A “processing environment” defines a set of cooperating computing resources, such as machines (processor and memory-enabled devices), storage, software libraries, software systems, etc. that form a logical computing infrastructure. A “logical computing infrastructure” means that computing resources can be geographically distributed across a network, such as the Internet. So, one computing resource at network site X and be logically combined with another computing resource at network site Y to form a logical processing environment. 
     The phrases “processing environment,” “cloud processing environment,” and the term “cloud” may be used interchangeably and synonymously herein. 
     Moreover, it is noted that a “cloud” refers to a logical and/or physical processing environment as discussed above. 
     Various embodiments of this invention can be implemented as enhancements within existing network architectures. 
     Also, the techniques presented herein are implemented in (and reside within) machines, such as processor(s) or processor-enabled devices (hardware processors). These machines are configured and programmed to specifically perform the processing of the methods and system presented herein. Moreover, the methods and system are implemented and reside within a non-transitory computer-readable storage media or machine-readable storage medium and are processed on the machines (processors) configured to perform the methods. 
     Of course, the embodiments of the invention can be implemented in a variety of architectural platforms, devices, operating and server systems, and/or applications. Any particular architectural layout or implementation presented herein is provided for purposes of illustration and comprehension of particular embodiments only and is not intended to limit other embodiments of the invention presented herein and below. 
     It is within this context that embodiments of the invention are now discussed within the context of the  FIGS. 1A-1C  and  2 - 4 . 
       FIGS. 1A-1C  flow diagrams depicting architectures and processing of processing TOTPs for social networks, according to an example embodiment presented herein. The  FIG. 1A  depicts an example architecture for performing TOTP authentication processing for users of social networks. 
     The architecture of the  FIG. 1A  is shown for purposes of illustration of particular embodiments of the invention; it is noted that other embodiments of the invention ( FIGS. 2-4 ) need not be limited to these architecture of the  FIG. 1A , as other hardware and software architectures can be used as well. 
     As embodiments herein and below will demonstrate, the data storage issue believed to be insurmountable for social networks to efficiently provide TOTP authentication becomes a nonissue. The embodiments allow mobile devices, such as an iPhones® to be used as the device token by simply loading and using a mobile application, and the embodiments allow an enhanced social networking service to provide a registration process that can be used to force policy on the use of the device token. This TOTP approach can be required for all access or only used as a “step-up,” or multi-factor authentication for some protected resources (based on the needs of the social network or services provided by that social network). 
     Embodiments of the invention have three main parts or processing flows to it. The first part includes is a “Time-based One Time Password Secret” (TOTPS) deployment service that securely delivers secrets to mobile devices. The second part is the TOTP generator for a mobile device, which builds a TOTP on the mobile device and displays it to the user. The third part is the validation of the TOTP from the mobile device at the social network service or social network authentication server. 
     The  FIG. 1A  depicts an architecture for practicing the three parts of the embodiments discussed herein. The architecture includes a mobile device (such as a smart phone but could be any mobile device selected from laptops, phones, tablets, wearable processing devices (GOGGLE GLASS®, smart watch, etc.), and the like). The architecture also includes one or more social networks (such as Facebook®, Twitter®, or different servers associated with a same social network (second instance of Facebook® in the diagram  100  of the  FIG. 1 . The architecture also includes a TOTP access appliance that services access to a protected resource, a single-factor authentication protected resource, and/or a multi-factor authentication protected resource. 
     Part 1—Token Secret Deployment: 
     For the mobile device to be a valid TOTP generator it must be trusted by the TOTP service. This trust is setup by delivering an “Invitation Token” (IT) to the mobile device. Ownership of the IT gives the rights to request a TOTPS. The TOTPS is used by the mobile device (may also be referred to as a “mobile client” herein) to generate the TOTP. The TOTP is used to validate possession of the device and secret (further details on this are described more completely herein and below). 
     For purposes of illustration an example operation scenario for embodiments of the invention a Security Assertion Markup Language federation approach is described for connecting to a “protected service.” The protected service acts as a Service Provider (SP) to the TOTP access appliance. Moreover, email is used as an out-of-band delivery mechanism for providing the IT to the user of the mobile device. It is to be noted that this is not the only mechanism for delivering the IT to the mobile device; thus, embodiments herein are not to be restricted to just email-based IT delivery mechanisms. 
       FIG. 1B  is a sample illustration of the IT distribution and TOTP generation. 
     The process starts with an administrator requesting an IT from the TOTP Access Appliance (hereinafter referred to as “TAA”). This request is done in a secure manner and is not shown in the  FIG. 1B . This can be a single request or an automated workflow or other process. When requesting the IT from the TAA, identity data about the user may be included in the request. The IT can include a “Time To Live” (TTL) attribute that limits the time that the IT can be used. In this example, the IT is distributed to the end user&#39;s email. This identity data is optional and can be any data know about the user&#39;s social identity. 
     At  1 , the admin sends an email message to the end user that includes a link to acquire the mobile application (mobile app) on the end user&#39;s mobile device; the IT is included in this link. This could also be an automated process occurring though an automated workflow or a manual process. The email may also include a link to automatically load the mobile app on the device. 
     At  2 , the end user reads the email and selects the link in the email that includes the IT. This starts the “Mobile App” (MA) on the mobile device and passes the IT with a “Register IT Request.” 
     At  3 , the MA requests a TOTPS from the TAA. The IT is passed to the TAA from the MA in the request. The TAA validates the IT. If the IT includes user identity data the data is decrypted. Based on policy, which may include any data available to the TAA (for example user data, social network list, and other company policy), a list of allowed social networks is built. 
     At  4 , the user is prompted to select a supported social network and then the TAA returns the results of the policy evaluation to the MA. The MA then uses mechanisms on the device, such as the browser to complete authentication to the social network. 
     At  5 , and if needed, the user inputs his/her social network credentials. This process may vary from one social network to another. When authenticated, the user receives an access token from the social network. It is to be noted that not all social login techniques are shown for the illustration; thus, others are possible without departing from the teachings herein. 
     At  6 , the access token is used by the TAA to read social network identity data about the user. If policy requires, the data read is compared to the data included in the original IT, in the present example the email address is compared. A unique social network identity globally-unique identifier (GUID) is also read from the social network. This GUID becomes the base of or seed for the TOTPS. The GUID and a TAA secret are combined together and hashed into a non-reversible key that is used as the TOPTS. 
     At  7 , the TOTPS is sent to the MA. 
     At  8 , the TOPTS is stored in the device&#39;s “key chain” by the MA. The mobile device now has a secret key that it holds in its key store. The TAA can calculate the same secret later during authentication. A “key chain,” as used herein, is a secure secrets store suitable for keys, certificates, tokens, and secrets. A “key store” may also refer to a key store, a credential store, an account database, and an account manager. 
     Part 2—Token Secret Use: 
       FIG. 1C  illustrates a process flow for two-factor authentication, according to an example embodiment. Again, SAML is used for the remote authentication and open standard for authentication (OAuth) is used to authenticate to the social network. These are example types of authentication mechanisms; others may be used as well without departing from the beneficial teachings provided herein. 
     At  1 , the user uses his/her browser to access a protected service that requires two-factor authentication. The first factor is to user the user&#39;s social network authentication. The second factor is to use TOTP, according to embodiments herein. It is to be noted that the processing for  FIG. 1C  at  1 - 4  and  8 - 10  are used only to show how an embodiment can be used in a company-hosted environment or by Software as a Service (SaaS) vendor; other arrangements for the processing of the  FIG. 1C  at  1 - 4  and  8 - 10  can also be used without departing from the teachings herein. 
     At  2 , because the protected service is not authenticated, the user is redirected to the SAML Service Provider (SP) and then sent to a trusted Identity Provider (IDP). 
     At  3 , the IDP is configured to enforce two-factor authentication. The first factor uses a social network, such as Facebook®. Moreover, the example uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication. An access token is returned after a successful authentication. 
     At  4 , the OAuth access token is used to read the user&#39;s identity information. The user&#39;s GUID and other optional attributes are read. 
     At  5 - 7 , beneficial aspects of the invention are realized. Specifically, at  5 , the social network GUID of the user and the TAA secret are used in a hash algorithm to produce a TOTPS. The user is then prompted to enter the “TOTPS via a form sent to the user&#39;s browser. The user runs the MA application on his/her mobile device. 
     At  6 , the MA read the TOTPS, which is stored in the key chain and hashes it with the “Time Of Day” (TOD), and then, the MA displays the results as the TOTP. The end user types (enters) the TOTP into the browser form on his/her desktop. Then, the browser submits the form. 
     At  7 , the form is sent to the TAA. The TAA hashes the TOD with the TOTPS, which was calculated at  5 . The two TOTP are compared. If the two TOTPs (user provided and TAA generated) match the user is successfully authenticated, if no match, then, the process is repeated for a time just before or after the current TOD. The TOD match may, in an embodiment, use the same mechanisms that are already used by current TOTP devices. The processing at  7  may be repeated for each valid TAA secret. 
     At  8 , the IDP returns a valid SAML token to the SP. 
     At  9 , the SP redirects the browser back to the protected resource. 
     At  10 , the user&#39;s browser on the mobile device is allowed access to the protected resource. 
     Part 3—TOTP Access Appliance Secret Management 
     In various embodiments, the TAA secret that is used to build the TOTPS can be a single secret or one of many secrets based on policy and security needs. The TAA secret selection can be based on an identity source as well as data that is read from the user&#39;s social network identity, time/date or other configured policies. 
     Moreover, the TAA may change its secrets at specified time periods, to limit the time that a mobile device&#39;s TOTPS is valid. The administrator can select this time base for each TAA. For example, the TAA secret can change every month. This would mean that a TOTP built from a TOTPS, which is more than a month old, would fail to validate. 
     In addition to the time-base limit of the TAA secret, the administrator can also select the number of TAA secrets the can be active at any given point in time. For example, the administrator could select the last three TAA secrets as being active. Such a scenario would allow a user to use his/her TOTPS for three months before the TAA would not validate the TOTP from the device. 
     The administrator may also setup an automatic refresh of the TOTPS. This would update the TOTPS on the mobile device if the TOTPS used a key that was older than a given numbers of secrets. In this way, active users do not need to keep receiving a new IT each month. Each time a user uses the TOTP, checks are made to ensure that the TAA secret was used to validate the TOTP and if the TAA secret is older than specified and configured requirements, a new TOTPS is deployed to the mobile device. The TOTPS update is based on policy that may include the user&#39;s identity data, location, and other input data. 
     Token Revocation 
     Because there is no server-side data store for devices that have valid TOTPS, there is a provided mechanism to revoke issued tokens. 
     If the TOTPS is being revoked because of a security loss of the TAA secret, the secret of the TAA is removed and a policy is defined detailing how the mobile devices can gain a new TOTPS. 
     If only a single mobile device needs to be disabled, a record is added to a “hot list.” The hot list includes the user&#39;s name, social network, a GUID from that social network, a reference to the TAA secret used to build the TOTPS, and a secure random number. When a user uses the TOTP and the GUID from the social network that matches a GUID in the “Hot List”, the random number is added as part of the hash to calculate the TOTP. So, any lost device will not know the random number to use and any TOTP sent by that lost device will not match. If the user on the hot list wishes to register a new device the secret sent to the device will use the random number as part of its hash calculation. Once the T AA secret used to build the TOTPS for the lost device has expired, the hot list entry can be deleted. 
     Techniques herein are improvements over preexisting technology because the protected service is not required to have an account or anything else stored. Other technologies require server-side storage to use TOTPs. The techniques herein have signification advantages where social network deployments are used as one of the authentication factors. Socially authenticated services can have millions or even billions of potential accounts and to remove the storage space and data liability is of great value. 
     Moreover, embodiments herein provide novel benefits for large organizations that wish to add TOTP based authentication to their services. Even though these companies may have a directory with their users represented therein, it is sometimes very difficult to get permission to change the directory schema or add a new database that holds credentials. In fact, many times corporate policy forbids such changes. The techniques herein also limit the risk of secret exposure because there is not a single server to hack and get the needed keys. 
     Furthermore, when techniques herein are hosted in a cloud environment, the techniques have an advantage of not having user keys and secrets stored on the cloud. 
     Still further, the techniques herein can be applied to any service that needs or wants to use TOTP-based approach. The techniques can be hosted by a single company or can be a shared service hosted in the cloud as a SAAS service. Moreover, the techniques can be used to protect on premise, off premise, and hosted SAAS services in a cloud. 
     Aspects of the embodiments discussed above and other embodiments are now presented with the discussion of the  FIGS. 2-4 . 
       FIG. 2  is a diagram of a method  200  for handing a TOTP of a network service, according to an example embodiment. The method  200  is implemented as one or more software modules (herein after referred to as “TOTP network manager”). The TOTP network manager includes executable instructions that are implemented, programmed, and resides within memory and/or a non-transitory machine-readable storage media; the executable instructions execute on one or more processors of a server device and have access to one or more network connections associated with one or more networks. The networks may be wired, wireless, or a combination of wired and wireless. 
     In an embodiment, the TOTP network manager processes on hardware platforms associated with a cloud environment. 
     In an embodiment, the TOTP network manager processes on hardware platforms controlled by a social network. 
     In an embodiment, the TOTP network manager is provided as a SaaS. 
     At  210 , the TOTP network manager receives a token, such as the invitation token discussed above with reference to the  FIGS. 1A-1C . The token is received from a mobile application that processes on a mobile device of a principal. 
     According to an embodiment, at  211 , the TOTP network manager invalidates the token when received after a time-to-live attribute associated with the token is determined by the TOTP network manager to have expired. 
     In an embodiment, at  212 , the TOTP network manager invalidates the token when the token does not identify the network service as an available network service for the principal. In an embodiment, the network service is a social network service. 
     In an embodiment, the token is encrypted and signed by either the TOTP network manager and distributed through a different process of the TOTP network manager or a trusted third-party service of the TOTP network manager. The encrypted token can include a variety of information, such as identifiers for the network service or services to which the token grants access to the principal to use the token and identity information associated with the principal. 
     At  220 , the TOTP network manager validates the token. Various options for performing the validation were discussed above with reference to the  FIGS. 1A-1C . 
     At  230 , the TOTP network manager detects a login by a principal to a network service. This was described above with reference to the  FIG. 1B . 
     According to an embodiment, at  231 , the TOTP network manager identifies the login from the mobile device during a registration request by the principal or an administrator for the principal to receive the TOTPS (discussed below). 
     In an embodiment of  231  and at  232 , the TOTP network manager detects the unique identity (discussed below) as an email associated with the principal for accessing the network service. 
     At  240 , the TOTP network manager obtains the unique identity supplied by the network service to the principal after a successful login. It is noted this can be any GUID that the network service assigns to the principal. It is also noted that in some embodiments the principal is a user and in other embodiments the principal is an automated service. 
     At  250 , the TOTP network manager generates a TOTPS based at least in part on the unique identity and a secret held just by the TOTPS. The TOTP network manager is capable of independently reproducing the TOTPS for the principal (and other TOTPS for other principals, each TOTPS specific to a specific principal). 
     According to an embodiment, at  251 , the TOTP network manager encrypts the TOTPS with instructions for generating a TOTP by the mobile application. These instructions may be as simple as identifying the data elements that are to be fed to the hash algorithm that resides on the mobile application and is used for generating the TOTPS. 
     At  260 , the TOTP network manager provides the TOTPS to a mobile application of a mobile device associated with the principal. The principal uses the mobile application to authenticate when the principal accesses a protected resource of the network service requiring a higher-level or multi-factor authentication for access. Once the TOTPS is generated by the TOTP network manager, the TOTPS is removed and is not retained by the TOTP network manager or the processing environment associated the TOTP network manager. So, the TOTP network manager has retained no data with respect to the principal, the mobile device, or the mobile application and yet, the TOTP network manager can provide TOTP authentication for the principal to the network service (as discussed above and below). 
     According to an embodiment, at  270 , the TOTP network manager subsequent to the processing at  260  receives a TOTP authentication request associated with the principal who is attempting to access the protected resource of the network service. 
     In an embodiment, the request was initiated by a different device from the mobile device associated with the principal. 
     In an embodiment, the request is initiated by the mobile device of the principal. 
     Continuing with the embodiment of  270 , the TOTP network manager regenerates the TOTPS using the TOTP network manager secret and a unique identity for the principal (supplied by the network service when the principal performed initial first-factor authentication with the network service, which then generated the request when the principal once logged into the network service tried to access the protected resource of the network service). Next, the TOTP network manager obtains a TOTP generated by the mobile application that hashes the TOTPS with a current TOD and the TOTP network manager receives that mobile-application generated TOTP from the different device (or in some cases the mobile device, as discussed above). 
     Still continuing with  270 , the TOTP network manager generates its own independent version of the TOTP by using the regenerated TOTPS and the TOD (note the TOTP hashing algorithms uses intervals of time, such that if the TOTP network manager is within the interval during which the mobile application generated its TOTP, the version of the TOTP network manager and the mobile application TOTP will be the same—when they are not the same the TOTP network manager can request a new TOTP from the mobile application and repeat the checking for a configured number of iterations). 
     Again, at  270 , the TOTP network manager authenticates the principal for access to the protected resource (on behalf of the network service) when the independent version of the TOTP produced by the TOTP network manager matches the TOTP supplied by the principal (either through the mobile device or a different device, such as a desktop of the principal or a different mobile device of the principal). 
     In an embodiment, at  280 , the TOTP network manager periodically resupplies a new TOTPS to the mobile application based on a policy evaluation. 
     According to an embodiment, at  290 , the TOTP network manager invalidates the mobile device for generating the TOTP based on the unique identity included in a hot list. 
     In an embodiment or  290  and at  291 , the TOTP network manager achieves this invalidation by altering a hash used to generate the TOTP to include a random number to prevent the mobile device from producing a mobile-device version of the TOTP (through its instance of the mobile application) that is capable of matching an independent version of the TOTP produced by the TOTP network manager. 
     In an embodiment of  291  and at  292 , the TOTP network manager sends a new TOTPS to a different instance of the mobile application on a different mobile device associated with the principal for the different instance of the mobile application to produce a version of the TOTP that will match the independent version of the TOTP produced by the TOTP network manager. 
     It is noted that the processing of  290 - 291  is particularly useful when a principal has a mobile device stolen or lost. 
     It should be now full appreciated how a network-based authenticator (the TOTP network manager) can assist a network service (such as a social network service) in providing enhanced multi-factor authentication to protected resources. This not only saves significant storage space and thereby expense because no information is stored in the process, but also may allow the network service to upsell value-added security services to its subscribers by providing the added security (multi-factor authentication). 
       FIG. 3  is a diagram of a method  300  for handing a TOTP on a mobile device, according to an example embodiment. The method  300  is implemented as one or more software module(s) (herein after referred to as “mobile TOTP app”). The one or more software module are represented as executable instructions that are implemented, programmed, and resides within memory and/or a non-transitory machine-readable storage medium; the executable instructions execute on one or more processors of a mobile device and have access to one or more network connections associated with one or more networks. The networks may be wired, wireless, or a combination of wired and wireless. 
     In an embodiment, the mobile TOTP app processes on a smart phone. 
     In an embodiment, the mobile TOTP app processes on a tablet device. 
     In an embodiment, the mobile TOTP app processes on a wearable processing device. 
     In an embodiment, the mobile TOTP app processes on a laptop computing device. 
     The mobile TOTP app interacts with the TOTP network manager, discussed above with reference to the  FIG. 2 . 
     At  310 , the mobile TOTP app provides an invitation token to a TOTP network manager, such as the TOTP network manager, discussed above with reference to the  FIG. 2 . Moreover, various embodiments, on how the invitation itself is issued and received by the mobile TOTP app were presented above with reference to the  FIG. 1B . 
     According to an embodiment, at  311 , the mobile TOTP app obtains the invitation token via an input supplied by the principal. So, the mobile TOTP app includes a forward facing principal interface and an Application Programming Interface (API) for communicating with the mobile TOTP app. 
     In an embodiment, at  312 , the mobile TOTP app obtains the invitation token via an automated process, such as through another API permitting automated applications to communicate with the TOTP. 
     According to an embodiment, at  313 , the mobile TOTP app periodically receives a new invitation token to replace the invitation token. 
     In an embodiment, the mobile TOTP app receives a set of valid invitation tokens for a configured period of time, which can be used and managed by the mobile TOTP app. 
     In an embodiment, at  314 , the mobile TOTP app supplies the invitation token to the TOTP network manager when the mobile TOTP app is first initiated for execution on the mobile device. 
     At  320 , the mobile TOTP app obtains a TOTPS, which was generated and supplied by the TOTP network manager but not stored by the TOTP network manager (but capable of being reproduced by the TOTP network manager based on identity information supplied by a network service that a particular principal is accessing). 
     In an embodiment, at  321 , the mobile TOTP app periodically obtains a new TOTPS from the TOTP network manager to replace the TOTPS. That is, the TOTPS is only valid for a period of time set by policy or until an event occurs defined by the policy and the policy is controlled by the TOTP network manager. 
     At  330 , the mobile TOTP app acquires a request to generate a TOTP for a principal. The principal already logged into a network service (first factor authentication) and is attempting to perform a second factor authentication using the TOTP. The principal can be accessing the network service via another application on the mobile device or on a completely different device from the mobile device. 
     At  340 , the mobile TOTP app generates the TOTP by hashing the TOTPS and a current TOD. 
     In an embodiment, at  341 , the mobile TOTP app adds a random number to the hashing when generating the TOTP based on instructions (data input to the hashing) embedded or encrypted in the TOTPS. 
     At  350 , the mobile TOTP app presents the TOTP on a display of the mobile device for use by the principal to access a protected resource of the network service. 
       FIG. 4  is a diagram of a TOTP network processing system  400 , according to an embodiment. Various components of the TOTP network processing system  400  are software module(s) represented as executable instructions, which are programed and/or reside within memory and/or non-transitory computer-readable storage media for execution by one or more devices. The components and the devices have access to one or more network connections over one or more networks, which are wired, wireless, or a combination of wired and wireless. 
     According to an embodiment, the TOTP network processing system  400  implements, in whole or in part and inter alia, various features of the  FIGS. 1A-1C  and  2 - 3 . 
     The TOTP network processing system  400  includes a server  401 , a TOTP network manager  402 , and a mobile app distributor  403 . 
     The server  401  includes one or more processors, memory, and non-volatile storage. 
     In an embodiment, the server  401  is a cloud processing environment. 
     In an embodiment, the server  401  is controlled or acts as an authentication device for social networking servers. 
     The server  401  includes the TOTP network manager  402  and the mobile app distributor  403 . 
     The TOTP network manager  402  is implemented as one or more software modules having executable instructions that execute on the one or more processors of the server  401 . The TOTP network manager  402  is configured and adapted to: generate a TOTPS for a principal; supply the TOTPS to the principal; remove the TOTPS from the server; regenerate the TOTPS to produce a server TOTPS on a per authentication basis; and authenticate a principal for access to a protected resource of a network service by comparing a principal-supplied TOTP to the server TOTP. 
     In an embodiment, the TOTP network manager  402  when executed provides TOTP authentication to network services from mobile devices. 
     In an embodiment, the mobile app distributor  402  is the TOTP network manager of the  FIG. 2 .

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     The present invention relates to the monitoring of gas concentrations possible in very low ranges (i.e. low ppb and even ppt ranges) and especially use thereof in environmental monitoring, exposure assessment, bomb detection, and health studies. The invention can use a spacial and temporal assessment of gas concentrations that enables the sources of the gas in question to be located and identified which is useful in environmental and health field but can also be applied to other fields an example of which is detecting and locating explosives. This technology uses small, light weight, and low power components that allow for the monitor to be portable and even worn on a person as a personal monitor. This technology can be used in stationary monitors as well. 
     This technology is a platform that can be tuned and adjusted to measure many different gases including but not limited to H2S, ammonia, SO2, NO2, and others even compounds that are related to explosives. 
     This personal or portable monitor can include a device that tracks spacial position for example a GPS device or a tracking system that works based on a receiver receiving a signal from stationary transmitters of known location and triangulating the position of the monitor based on the signals received. 
     This monitor will include a means to record and store the gas concentration, special position and time of the readings. This monitor can be fitted with the provision to transmit the data collected either by a wire connection or a wireless transmitter to a computer station or other similar device. The data can then be stored and archived and analyzed; using algorithms designed to watch and notify if conditions of concern arise. These algorithms can include spacial and temporal analysis of the gas concentrations (in effect mapping of the gas concentration) that may provide evidence of the sources of the gases being measured (i.e. locate the sources). 
     Several monitors can be downloading (by wireless transmissions if needed) to a single database that is updated and maintained with the algorithms applied to constantly compare the new data to previously collected data and watch for anomalies that can identify undesirable conditions. For example, multiple mobile monitors can measure and transmit concentration and position information to a central computer which combines and analyzes the information and can characterise the gas concentrations over an area that is useful for exposure, environmental and health concerns. The information can also identify and locate sources of the gas in question which is valuable in trying to reduce the concentration of the gases by locating and eliminating the source. For example this would be useful in industrial operations were some fugitive emission of gases go unnoticed by the standard air monitoring networks. This method would be useful in many other fields including the detection and locating of explosive devices within apartment buildings or outdoor environments including public areas. 
     The work done to prove the concept of this invention is in two major areas, first the gas monitor, and secondly the spacial temporal gas concentration analysis. 
     The following is a description of a monitor that uses electrochemical cells that have a low noise to signal ration which makes them very sensitive. The cells used in the prototype are made by TSI but other similarly sensitive cells would work the same. The prototype was tuned to and tested on H2S gas but it can be tuned to measure other gases. The present prototype superimposed a gas concentration of the target gas on the sensors and generates this gas using electrochemical cells (made by ACD) but could use other electrochemical cells or methods to generate the gas on the monitor. 
     The super imposed gas does not have to be the same as the gas to be measured. A different gas could be used to react with and eliminated the effect of an interfering gas, or react with the target gas and form a different compound which is then measured on the sensitive sensors. Similarly a different gas could be introduced into the sample stream that forms a compound on the surface of the sensors that will react more readily with the target gas and provide a stronger signal. In effect, the superimposed gas can be used to isolate or amplify the signal from the target gas. 
     The development of the invention has used three prototypes (three phases) to prove the concept of measuring low concentration of gases on a small light weight monitor that could be portable or personally worn. This development has targeted H2S and other reduced sulphur compounds but the same methods could be used to measure other gases. The following describes the development. It is possible to replace individual components of these prototypes with other things not mentioned that perform the same function. 
     The methodology was developed to monitor low ppb (parts per billion) air concentrations of H2S in real time with small light weight equipment adaptable to portable or even personal monitors. 
     In the first phase an investigation of monitoring techniques determined that highly sensitive electrochemical sensors (amperametric sensor) were the most promising technique given their small size and low power requirements. 
     The difficulties with the electrochemical sensors are that they respond to many compounds (lack of selectivity) and the response to low ppb levels of H2S is not consistent. While they are sensitive enough to respond to 1 ppb H2S the response is not consistent and varies with humidity, sensor baseline, and recent exposures to H2S. The sensor responds to H2S concentrations with a measurable increase in current that rises logarithmically requiring hours to reach to a stable output and similar time to return to the pre exposure baseline levels. During this logarithmic increase or decrease in current measured the sensor sensitivity to H2S changes making it difficult to predict H2S concentrations. 
     The methodology developed incorporated the following techniques to address the complicating factors: Impose bias voltage (+300 mv) on sensor to reduce sensor response to other reactive gases (phase  1 ); Frequent Baseline correction (phase  1 ); Frequent calibration cycles (to measure sensor sensitivity) (phase  1 ); Using multiple sensors to improve accuracy and eliminate outliners (phase  1 ); Superimposed H2S concentration on the sample (to maintain sensor sensitivity) (phase  2 ); Gas specific filters to further isolate the sensor&#39;s response to H2S (phase  2 ); Logarithmic curve fitting to measure sensor response (phase  2 ). The first phase of the investigation used a prototype monitor with the capability to adjust bias voltage, baseline correct, sensitivity correct, and used multiple sensors. This prototype had limited data logging capability only taking readings every ten seconds. The following information was obtained from the investigation. 
       FIG. 1  shows data collected over three days comparing the H2S concentrations measured by a commercial ambient monitor versus a prototype monitor using electrochemical sensors (calibrated with the average sensitivity over the time period). The figure shows that overall the prototype monitors response is correlated with H2S concentrations but there are large errors for an individual measure. These errors are due to the sensor sensitivity and baseline drifting during the sample period. 
       FIG. 2  show data corrected for the sensor baseline response overlaid upon the raw data from  FIG. 1 . An estimate of the baseline was obtained by periodically running the sample through a zero gas filter and measuring the sensor response. The figure shows there is a great reduction in the scatter of the data particularly at the lower concentrations. There is still considerable error in the measurements at the higher end of the scale. 
       FIG. 3  shows data that has been corrected for changing sensor sensitivity over time overlaid upon the previous data. There is significant reduction in the error. Sensor sensitivity was determined by periodically exposing the sensor to known concentrations of gas and recording the response (basically recalibration). 
       FIG. 4  shows the improvements of the prototype monitors predictions when multiple sensors are averaged. 
       FIG. 5  plots the percent relative standard deviation (RSD, this is the standard deviation of a group of data points at a given H2S concentration divided by the mean of those points) versus the H2S concentration. The figure shows the improvements in the prototype monitors precision resulting from the application of the methodologies discussed in this section. An estimate of the detection limit of the monitor is obtained by reading the H2S concentration when the fit lines cross the 33% RSD (this is related to three standard deviation of the instrument background noise which is a commonly used by laboratories as the limit of detection). The detection limit of the prototype operating with baseline correction, sensitivity correction, and multiple sensors is roughly 2 to 3 ppb. 
     In the second phase a second prototype was constructed with the following improvements: 1. The capability to generate a H2S concentration to superimpose on the sample 2. The capability to quickly change the superimposed H2S concentration for calibration purposes by adjusting the flow rate which increases the concentration of the superimposed H2S concentration which allows for a simple method to check sensor sensitivity providing a convenient calibration method 3. A record rate of three readings per second The monitor continuously cycles the sensors through the following four modes of operation: 1. Baseline calibration 2. Span calibration 3. Sample reading 4. Sample reading with an H2S filter Combining the information from the four modes provides a good estimate of the H2S concentration as well as other reactive sulphur compounds. The monitor has grouped the six onboard sensors into groups of two and offset the modes of operation so that there is always a set of sensors reading a sample (maintaining a continuous monitor). 
     The following sections summarize the findings of the investigation of the second prototype. 
       FIG. 6  shows the output of five of the sensors working in synchronized modes of operation and being exposed to varying concentration of H2S and methyl mercaptan (a common interfering gas that can also be detected by the human nose at low concentrations). The figure shows the similar magnitude of response between the sensors. This similarity in response is a result of a 25 ppb superimposed H2S concentration that maintains the concentration of the secondary reaction products on the sensor surface and provides similar sensor sensitivities. 
     The capability to quickly change the superimposed H2S concentration for calibration purposes and the increased recording rate has enable the monitor to operate in short cycles that help to eliminate noise and allows for better interpretation of the sensor output.  FIG. 7  is a sample of a cycle for one sensor exposed to roughly 1 ppb of H2S. The modes of the cycle are listed on the figure. Comparing the output during the sample modes and the H2S filter mode is an indication of the response to 1 ppb. Similarly in  FIG. 8  the response to 8 ppb is shown. In  FIG. 9  the comparison of the line during the H2S filter mode and the baseline calibration is an indication of 15 ppb methyl mercaptan that was present along with 8 ppb H2S. 
     The cycles used here are examples of how they can be used to measure gas concentrations. The ordering of the parts of the cycle can be changed and not all the parts of the cycle are required to measure the gas concentration. 
       FIG. 10  demonstrates how logarithmic fitted curves will be used to fit to the output and compared to quantify sensor output. The first part of the figure is the sample mode while the second part is the H2S filter mode the arrow indicates the sensor response. 
     In the third phase the product is a monitor for H2S that enable personal/portable monitoring with a low ppb detection limit. In addition to H2S, the monitor also estimates a concentration of a group of other reduced sulphur compounds (ORS) having odours that are sometimes mistaken for H 2 S. 
     The monitor uses highly sensitive electrochemical sensors (also called amperametric sensor) because of their small size and low power requirements. The difficulties with the electrochemical sensors are that they respond to many compounds (lack of selectivity) and the response to low ppb levels of H2S is not consistent. While they are sensitive enough to respond to 1 ppb H2S the response is not consistent and varies with humidity, sensor baseline, and recent exposures to H2S. The sensor responds to H2S concentrations with a measurable increase in current that rises logarithmically requiring hours to reach a stable output and similar time to return to the pre-exposure baseline levels. During this logarithmic increase or decrease in current measured the sensor sensitivity to H2S changes making it difficult to predict H2S concentrations. 
     A methodology was developed to address the complicating factors using the following techniques: Imposed bias voltage (+300 mv) on sensor to reduce sensor response to other reactive gases; Frequent Baseline correction; Periodic calibration (to measure sensor sensitivity); Using multiple sensors to improve accuracy and eliminate outliners; Superimposed H2S concentration on the sample (to maintain sensor sensitivity); Gas specific filters to further isolate the sensor&#39;s response to H2S; Logarithmic curve fitting to measure sensor response. The schematic diagram in  FIG. 11  illustrates the layout of the components used to implement the methodology developed. The monitor uses two special electrochemical sensors with bias voltage adjustment on each of three channels. The valves on each channel switch rapidly (15 sec. to 5 min.) between drawing an air sample; an air sample with the H2S filtered out, or an air sample with all contaminants removed for a baseline reading. The H2S and ORS signals are calculated based on the difference in the sensor output between the different samples. Logarithmic curve fitting is use to quantify the differences in sensor output as illustrated in  FIG. 10  for a sensor exposed to 1 ppb H2S. Low levels of H2S are generated in each channel and superimposed on the sample with a controlled flow loop. Exit filters remove any H2S that has been added before the air leaves the monitor. Because low humidity can damage the sensors a humidity module at the intake will increase moisture in the sample. A calibration module will be connected to the monitor periodically to provide calibration. In between main calibrations, a sensitivity check (quasi calibration) is possible by decreasing the flow which increases the superimposed H2S concentration by a known amount to the sensors. 
     The methodology described above has been demonstrated in laboratory and field test in a briefcase size prototype. The components (filters, manifolds, circuit boards) displayed in the prototype are much larger than necessary and can be miniaturized so the size and power consumption is suitable for a battery powered personal monitor. Laboratory test results are shown in  FIG. 12  for H.sub.2S levels of 0, 6, 12, and 24 PPB generated in a chamber in the laboratory. Note the changes in concentration in the chamber were associated with the transition periods shown in the figure and do not reflect the response time of the monitor. Data from ten days of field-tests where the prototype was collocated with an ambient monitor at an Alberta Environmental Protection station is shown in  FIG. 13 . The field and laboratory test data shows good agreement to the expected H.sub.2S, concentrations in the low ppb range. The field test data in  FIG. 13  also shows predicted levels of the ORS present at the site. 
     The portable version of the monitor includes three channels providing continuous measurements of H.sub.2S, ORS, and baseline levels. Size and weight can be minimized in the personal monitor by using only one channel, which would provide an intermittent measure of H2S and ORS rather than a continuous measure. 
     The unique aspects of low detection limit, light weight, and low power operation will compete with existing monitoring systems and open new markets in areas considered impractical at this time. 
     The portable monitors will allow government agencies to respond to public complaints by taking measurements to determine the level of H 2 S and ORS. The personal monitor will provide information for health assessments and could be used to provide concentration data for studies that look at the impact on human and animal life. Industries would also be interested in the monitors for the reasons above as well as the benefits gained from collecting this air data with an added spacial/temporal analysis which can locate sources of contamination. 
     Innovation in technology can precipitate profound changes in practices and approaches to problems. Low ppb air quality monitoring has been characterized by permanent ambient monitoring stations that are costly and lack flexibility in addressing public concerns about air quality and health. A portable/personal monitor with ambient monitor detection limits opens the possibility of answering the questions the public is raising that are impractical to address with the current monitoring regime and provide valuable solution to other questions that industries haven&#39;t considered yet. With respect to the Spacial Temporal Gas Concentration Analysis, the following is the proof of concept. A study of PAH concentrations resulting from a coal fired household furnace is provided to demonstrate the concept of locating sources using spacial and temporal gas concentration (although the PAH are fine particulate bounds they act as a gas for the purposes of this analysis in this instance). 
     A residence in Vegreville, Alberta was monitored over a five week period for outdoor air concentrations of PAHs and between Feb. 21 and Mar. 28, 2003. Measurements of PAHs were taken using a real-time monitor (PAS 2000 CE PAH monitor, Ecochem Analytics Inc.). The location of the residence monitored was roughly 100 meters east of the location of the coal fired furnace. Meteorological data was obtained from an Environment Canada weather station located roughly 3 km from the residences. 
     A comparison between the real-time outdoor measures of PAHs and the wind conditions at the time can provide insight into sources of emissions. Studies have shown that weak air movements or calm conditions over cities are correlated with poorer air quality due to pollution not being effectively dispersed. Where no significant point source of PAHs exists in the community or region, the highest concentration of PAHs occur at calm or low wind speeds and the levels decrease to low background levels at high wind speeds. 
     The real-time PAH and wind data was combined and plotted in  FIG. 14  which shows a surface representing the mean of the outdoor real-time PAH levels versus wind speed and direction. The figure shows an increase in the average PAH concentration at elevated wind speeds from the westerly direction indicating a point source in the direction of the coal-fired furnace. A plot of the average PAH levels versus wind direction and temperature shows increased levels when the wind is from the west at temperatures below 15° C. (see  FIG. 15 ). This is as expected given the coal furnace will be producing more heat and higher emission at these low temperatures. Recharting the wind speed and direction diagram using only data with temperature below 15° C. in  FIG. 16  shows a dramatic increased impact of the coal furnace at colder temperatures. These figures demonstrate that a point source existed in the direction of the coal furnace and impacted the house monitored when the wind was above 10 km/hr in the direction spanning west-southwest to northwest at temperatures below 15° C. The coal furnace was responsible for the increased PAH levels assuming there were no other significant point sources of products of incomplete combustion in that direction. 
     This demonstrates how directions of the point sources can be located with real-time concentration data and wind speed and direction data. If data were collected in many locations then the directions provided can be used to pin point the sources location by over laying the directions. With moving monitors the data will be analyzed using a quasi finite element analysis with data from finite geographic areas grouped together and compared with wind speed and direction. Point sources will appear in each finite element similar to the PAH surface in  FIG. 16 . Lines struck in the direction to a point source from the centroid of several finite elements will cross at the location of the point source. Computer algorithms will be created to perform these tasks on a continuous basis and will be able to determine if new point sources emerge and provide alarms or warning of such. 
     Wind is not a consideration in indoor environments were concentration data will be mapped and areas of higher concentration will indicate proximity to sources. Temporal patterns of concentrations indoors can also be used to identify sources. 
     This inventions application to explosive detection as well as many other area is demonstrated here. Sep. 13, 1999 at least 116 people are killed when an eight-story Moscow apartment building is blown up by an explosion. Sep. 9, 1999 an explosion collapses the middle of a nine-story apartment building in a residential Moscow neighborhood, killing 93 people. In both of these cases large bombs were detonated within the buildings. This type of attack could pose a significant threat to America as foreign students or those posing as students could carry explosives in backpacks into apartment buildings unnoticed and build up a bomb weighing tons in a matter of weeks. This large bomb could be easily detonated by a cell phone call from anywhere. 
     Portable explosive detection devices carried by security personal walking apartment hallways would be able to detect bomb-building activity in the suites. Further, a number of these portable detectors could wirelessly link to a central computer to provide a explosive surveillance system. This system could provide long-term monitoring of a building for the presence of explosive devices or be used for one-time sweeps of a number of buildings. It could also provide surveillance for explosive devices in public where it is difficult to screen people entering different areas. 
     This approach would locate explosives by identifying anomalies in air concentration of an explosive indicator compound monitored over space and time. The system would compare concentration patterns from one area to another and would track changes in concentration patterns at one location over time. The system would use small portable gas detection monitors (with ultra low detection limits) carried by personnel. The monitors would be tuned to detect a gas that is given off by explosive materials and would transmit the data along with monitor position to a central computer in real time. The central computer would compile the data and generate a map of the characteristic concentrations of the indicator gas over the area in question—such as a large apartment building or public gathering place to be used as reference for future readings. The central computer would use powerful statistical algorithms to analyze the incoming data and identify any spacial or temporal anomalies in the air concentrations that require additional monitor passes or other appropriate responses to confirm the presence of an explosive device. 
     The effectiveness of such an explosive surveillance system would be limited by the detection limit of the portable monitors. It is not clear what detection limit would be required but it could be in the part per billion or trillion (ppb or ppt) range. A small portable air monitor with this detection limit is not commercially available but it may be possible to develop one. 
     An environmental issue being addressed by this concept is fugitive emissions of natural gas. Fugitive natural gas leaks are a significant contributor of green house gas (GHG) emissions and are responsible for gas losses estimated at roughly $200 million annually in Canada. A goal of this initiative is to develop a system that measures the amount of fugitive emissions at a facility and localizes the major emission sources within that facility using continuous point measures of methane. 
     The current approach to measuring overall fugitive natural gas emissions at a facility involves open path optical sensing systems. These systems use a beam of light projected over a long distance (usually along the facility boundary) to measure the air concentrations of natural gas and predict the facility fugitive emission rate (see, for example,  FIG. 17 ). Advanced systems can also locate individual plumes. Alberta Research Council (ARC) has demonstrated the Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) technology which can provide two and three dimensional pictures of plumes at a facility boundary (Presentation to PTAC Air Issues Forum. Nov. 19, 2003. 
     http://www.ptac.org/env/dl/envf0303p11.pdf). 
     The current approaches to localize fugitive emission sources use hand-held instruments that personnel carry through a facility either measuring the size of leaks or looking for leaks. The size of a leak is determined by measuring natural gas concentrations in the immediate vicinity of the leak (i.e. sniffing a flange). Currently, leaks are located by sniffing all potential locations. Recent advances will see hand-held sensors (open path optical sensors or infrared cameras) that can be used to locate plumes from leaks several meters from the monitor. 
     These current methods use high-intensity data collection over a short period of time and provide a snap shot of the fugitive emission at a facility. The innovation in the proposed technology will both localize fugitive sources and characterize overall site emissions in a continuous manner using long-term, low intensity data collection combined with sophisticated data analysis. 
     The purpose of the new technology is to characterize overall facility emissions and localize the sources of these emissions using point measures combined with a sophisticated data analysis. This concept would result in a continuous surveillance system that consists of a monitor feeding data to a computer that updates a fugitive emission map of the facility. The crux of the idea is that a sophisticated analysis of continuous point measures is a more efficient and effective method to characterize and reduce fugitive emission than the current alternatives of short duration facility audits using systems like the DIAL laser or handheld sensor carried by personnel. 
     The only other alternative that attempts to do both source localization and overall site fugitive emission measures is the DIAL system demonstrated by ARC. The one DIAL system planned for Western Canada would move between sites and provide snap shots of plume profiles at the facility perimeter. The continuous nature of the proposed system is a significant improvement over the DIAL system in that it will better support continuous improvement strategies at facilities. Facility managers and operators will have continuous feedback of the impact changes in operational practices and procedures have on fugitive emission which will be a powerful tool in continuous improvement strategies. 
     If adequate resolution of leak location is achieved, the proposed technology could also be an alternative to the hand-held leak location devices currently in use. These hand-held systems depend on personnel to move the monitor into the plume for measurement with the position of the monitor identifying the leak location. In contrast, the proposed technology relies on the wind to carry the plume from the leak location to the monitor, which is stationary, and traces back to the location of the leak using computer algorithms to analyze the wind information. Again, the crux of this approach is that it will be more effective (and less expensive) to leave a monitor running in a fixed location and have a computer perform a complex analysis of the data than it is to have personnel move the monitor around with little analysis of the plume. An important advantage of the proposed system is that it performs a continuous exhaustive surveillance of the entire facility where the hand monitors only finds leaks where and when they are looked for, leaving leaks in unsuspected locations undetected. As a possible limitation, the proposed system will provide a continuous measure of the leakage rate from a building but will not likely be able to resolve leak location within the building. 
     The technologies current stage of development is a conceptual field prototype. The fundamental concepts of the technology have been demonstrated in the field with other contaminants but have not been attempted on natural gas. The fundamental concept of, locating contaminant plumes with point measures has been demonstrated in previous work identifying emissions from a coal fired furnace. The attached  FIG. 16  taken from an unpublished study by the applicant shows the average levels of point measures of PAH concentrations plotted with wind speed and direction. This figure represents five weeks of data taken from a location near a house that was burning coal for heat. The contaminant plume shows up on the figure as a spike in concentration with wind from the west (the direction source) at 20 km/h. The figure shows how sources can be located using point measurements rather than open path optical sensing systems. This same approach will be able to locate the plumes of natural gas fugitive emissions. 
     This project will determine the sensitivity (i.e. how small of a leak can be located to what resolution) of the surveillance system. Additionally, the relationship between field monitor performance and system sensitivity will be determined (i.e. what quality of monitor do you need to make an effective system). 
     The market potential for the technology is a surveillance system for every gas plant A surveillance system can be available soon after the project is complete (or even before) if it uses commercially available monitors and manual data analysis (performed offsite). With experience, the data analysis will be streamlined and software will be developed to completely automate the analysis component of the system and provide on-site data analysis in real time. Given a sufficient market driver, the ideal surveillance system that uses a low maintenance monitor with on-site real time data analysis could be available in two years. 
     Traditional air dispersion modeling starts with a source of known character and predicts down-wind plume concentrations under assumed meteorological conditions. This concept endeavors go in the opposite direction by measuring plume concentrations and predicting source characteristics (location, size, etc.). Algorithms developed to solve this puzzle can be readily applied to data collected at facilities to provide valuable information to reduce fugitive emissions.","1.

     DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 
     Reference will now be made in detail to various embodiments, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings. In the following detailed description, numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of the present inventions. However, it will be apparent to one of ordinary skill in the art that the present inventions may be practiced without these specific details. In other instances, well-known methods, procedures, components, and circuits have not been described in detail so as not to unnecessarily obscure aspects of the embodiments. 
       FIG. 1  is a block diagram illustrating a communication system  100  in accordance with some embodiments. The communication system  100  includes a hand-held, wireless mobile communication device  110  with an antenna  120  for wireless communication. While the antenna  120  is shown as extending from the mobile communication device  110  for visual clarity, the antenna  120  may be implemented internally within the mobile communication device  110 . Also, the mobile communication device  110  may include more than one antenna  120 . The mobile communication device  110  includes a user interface for entering data. For example, a display  124  ( FIG. 2 ) is a touch-screen display; alternatively or in addition, the mobile communication device  110  includes a keypad  125  ( FIG. 2 ) for entering data. 
     A secure element  130  is physically coupled to the mobile communication device  110 . In some embodiments, the secure element  130  is externally attached to the mobile communication device  110 . For example, the secure element  130  is adhesively affixed or mechanically secured to the housing of the mobile communication device  110 . Alternatively, the secure element  130  is permanently integrated inside the mobile device or housed within a slot located inside the mobile communication device  110 . The secure element  130  includes an antenna  131  for wireless communication. While the antenna  131  is shown as extending from the secure element  130  for visual clarity, the antenna  131  may be implemented internally within the secure element  130 . Also, the secure element  130  may include more than one antenna  131 . Communication occurs wirelessly between the secure element  130  and the mobile communication device  110  via respective antennas  120  and  131 , over a direct wireless channel  163  between the mobile communication device  110  and the secure element  130 . Thus, in some embodiments, the channel  163  does not pass through a network. 
     The secure element  130  also can communicate wirelessly with different point-of-sale (POS) or point-of-entry (POE) terminals  150 - 1  to  150 -N via the antenna  131 . In some embodiments, a POS terminal  150  receives a transaction request signal from the secure element  130  and transmits the transaction request signal to a transaction server  170  over a network  160 . Alternatively, a POE terminal  150  receives an entry request signal from the secure element  130  and transmits the entry request signal to the transaction server  170  over the network  160 . The network  160  is any suitable wired and/or wireless network and may include, for example, a local area network (LAN), wide area network (WAN), virtual private network (VPN), the Internet, a metropolitan area network (MAN), or any combination of these or similar networks. The transaction server  170  verifies the request and forwards a verification signal to the management server  180  via the network  160 . The management server  180  identifies the user corresponding to the verification signal and provides a response signal back to the mobile communication device  110 , which the mobile communication device  110  receives via the antenna  120 . The response signal thus is communicated back to the mobile communication device  110  using a communication channel that is different from the communication channel used to initiate the transaction. Alternatively, the response signal is communicated back to the mobile communication device  110  using communication channels from the management server  180  to the secure element  130  through the network  160  and POS terminal  150 , and then from the secure element  130  to the mobile communication device  110  via the antennas  131  and  120 . 
     In the example of an entry request signal received at a POE terminal  150 , the entry request is verified by the POE terminal  150  or the transaction server  170 , upon which the POE terminal  150  admits the user of the mobile communication device  110  to the corresponding venue or facility. 
       FIG. 2  is a block diagram illustrating selected elements of the mobile communication device  110  in accordance with some embodiments. A processor  123  is coupled to a wireless radio transceiver  122 , a display  124 , a keypad  125 , and a memory  126 . The radio transceiver  122  is connected to an antenna  120 - 1 , which is an example of an antenna  120  (FIG.  1 ) and is adapted to send outgoing voice and data signals and receive incoming voice and data signals over a radio communication channel. The radio communication channel can be a digital radio communication channel (e.g., a cellular channel as provided by a cellular service provider), such as a CDMA or GSM channel Such a radio communication channel has the capacity to communicate both voice and data messages using conventional techniques. In some embodiments, the processor  123  also is coupled to a second wireless transceiver  129  (e.g., a Bluetooth or WiFi transceiver), connected to a corresponding antenna  120 - 2  (which is another example of an antenna  120 ,  FIG. 1 ), for communicating with an external device over an additional communication channel separate from the radio communication channel associated with the transceiver  122 . 
     The processor  123  has the capability to perform not only the radio communication services necessary to allow for phone and data communications (e.g., via the transceivers  122  and/or  129 ), but also to execute various application programs (e.g., applications  620 ,  FIG. 6 ) that are stored in the memory  126 . These application programs can receive inputs from the user via the display  124  and/or keypad  125 . In some embodiments, application programs stored in the memory  126  and run on the processor  123  are, for example, iPhone, Android, Windows Mobile, BREW, J2ME, or other mobile applications and can encompass a broad array of application types. Examples of these applications include e-commerce applications  622  ( FIG. 6 ), games  626  ( FIG. 6 ), enterprise applications  628  ( FIG. 6 ), and multimedia applications  630  ( FIG. 6 ). E-commerce applications can include ticketing applications; content, item and service purchase applications; and/or payment management applications. One example of an e-commerce application that runs on the processor  123  and is stored in the memory  126  is an event application that provides event information and ticketing (e.g., for movies, concerts, sports, airplanes, busses, trains, etc). In some implementations, the processor  123  recognizes secure communications (e.g., as received via the transceiver  122  and/or  129 ) and transmits data from the secure communications to the secure element  130  for storage therein. The processor  123  also processes data received from the secure element  130 . 
       FIG. 3A  is a block diagram illustrating a secure element  130   a  in accordance with some embodiments. The secure element  130   a,  which is an example of the secure element  130  ( FIG. 1 ), includes a processor  132 , a memory  133 , and a wireless transceiver  134  with a corresponding antenna  131 - 1 , a microphone  137 , a speaker  139 , and audio to digital converter  135 , and audio cable  141  that has a 3.55 mm plug . The memory  133  includes a memory element  138  (e.g., a register, or alternatively a group of memory cells in a memory array in the memory  133 ) for storing an identifier (e.g., a serial number) associated with the secure element  130   a.  The memory element  138  is non-volatile and thus can store the identifier even in the absence of power. The transceiver  134  is adapted to communicate wirelessly with POS and POE terminals  150  ( FIG. 1 ). For example, the transceiver  134  is adapted to send transaction request signals to POS terminals  150 , to send entry request signals to POE terminals  150 , and to receive corresponding responses from the terminals  150 . In some embodiments, the transceiver  134  is a near-field communication (NFC) transceiver (e.g., operating in accordance with the ISO 18092 standard), which includes an NFC modem. In some implementations, the NFC modem has a set of registers that can be read and written by the processor  132  and are also available for reading and writing by an external device (e.g., a POS or POE terminal  150 ) over the wireless (e.g., RFID) communications channel between the transceiver  134  and the external device. This set of registers serves, for example, as a shared memory between the processor  132  within the secure element  130  and an RFID reader associated with a POS or POE terminal  150 . This communication between the secure element  130   a  and POS or POE terminal  150  is performed, for example, in accordance with the ISO 14443A/B standard and/or the ISO 18092 standard. 
     In some embodiments, the secure element  130   a  includes one or more additional transceivers  136  (e.g., radio, Bluetooth, and/or WiFi transceivers) and associated antennas  131 - 2 . The one or more additional transceivers  136  are adapted to communicate wirelessly with the mobile communication device  110  (e.g., via the transceiver  122  and/or  129  ( FIG. 2 ) in the mobile communication device  110 ). 
     In some embodiments, the secure element  130   a  includes a second microphone ( 137 ), a second speaker ( 139 ) , a second analog to digital converter ( 136 ), and a second battery as shown in  FIG. 3   b . These components are adapted to communicate wirelessly with the mobile communication device  110  (e.g., via the microphone  118  and/or speaker  117  ( FIG. 2 ) in the mobile communication device  110 ). 
     In some embodiments, the secure element  130 , while physically coupled to the mobile communication device  110 , is not electrically coupled to the device  110  and does not receive power from the device  110 . Instead, for example, the secure element  130   a  receives RF power from a remote terminal (e.g., a POS or POE terminal  150 ) resulting from induction when in proximity to the remote terminal and uses this power to operate the processor  132 , memory  133 , and transceivers  134  and  136 . 
     In some embodiments, the secure element  130  is electronically coupled to the mobile communication devices and receives its power directly from the battery  128  within the mobile communication device. This is accomplished when the mobile wallet application which resides on the mobile communication device sends a low voltage current using the cable  141  connected to the secure element in order to trigger induction and to activate the secure element

This is accomplished when the mobile wallet application which resides on the mobile communication sends an audio signal and thereby creating an electronic current over the cable  141  connected to the secure element which triggers induction and activates the secure element  130   
     In some embodiments, the components of the secure element  130   a  are implemented on a single integrated circuit (IC); this single integrated circuit is sometimes referred to as a smart chip. The smart chip and any other components (e.g., the battery  140 ,  FIG. 3B , or power harvesting circuitry  144 ,  FIG. 3C ) of the secure element  130  are encased within a card, referred to as a smart card, that serves as a housing of the secure element  130 . In some embodiments, the smart card is adhesively affixed to the mobile communication device  110  and is referred to as a sticker. 
       FIG. 3D  illustrates top and side views of a smart card  130   d,  which is an example of a secure element  130  ( FIG. 1 ). The smart card  130   d  can be attached (e.g., affixed) externally to a mobile communication device  110 . In  FIG. 3D , the smart card  130   d  has a circular shape. The smart card  130   d  can have other suitable shapes (e.g., rectangular, triangular, and so on). The smart card  130   d  includes an embedded smart chip  702  that includes the components of the secure element  130   a  ( FIG. 3A ). The smart chip  702  is capable of 2-way wireless communication with a remote terminal (e.g., a POS or POE terminal  150 ) and with the mobile communication device  110  using the transceivers  134  or  136 . 
     In some embodiments, the transceivers  134  and/or  136  in the smart chip  702  are low-power RF transceivers. Their low power output makes them susceptible to RF interference from neighboring devices, such as the mobile communication device  110  to which the smart card  130   d  is attached. Thus, in some implementations, the smart card  130   d  includes an RF shield to insulate the smart chip  702  from external interference. In one implementation, a lining of the smart chip  702  is composed of an RF absorbent material. In general, each phone has different levels of interference, and a material, size and thickness of the RF lining can determine an effectiveness of the RF shield. Alternatively, instead of incorporating an RF shield within the smart card  130   d,  an RF shield can be placed between the smart card  130   d  and the mobile communication device  110 . 
     Given the abuse a mobile communication device  110  can take, smart cards  130   d  that are attached externally to a mobile communication device are designed to withstand some abuse. In some embodiments, the smart card  130   d  includes a ruggedized shell  704  that encases the smart chip  702 . In some implementations, the shell  704  is formed of a composite plastic or polymer. The shell  70  can be hard (and substantially inflexible) or soft (and pliable). In some implementations, the shell  704  includes a protective membrane for the smart chip  702  which prevents damage to internal circuitry of the smart chip  702 , a surface to adhere to an RF lining and/or the mobile communication device  110  with appropriate adhesive, and a surface that faces outward when the smart card  130   d  is attached to the mobile communication device  110 , on which to print branding and advertising. Types of adhesives that can be used to affix the smart card  130   d  to the mobile communication device  110  include, for example, paper glue, super glue, adhesive polymers, and the like. In one implementation, the shell  704  has a maximum width (or diameter) of 25 mm, and has a maximum thickness (or depth) of 5 mm. 
     In some embodiments, instead of being externally attached to the mobile communication device  110 , a secure element  130  is physically coupled to the mobile communication device  110  by being disposed internally within a body of the mobile communication device  110 . For example, as shown in  FIG. 3E  in accordance with some embodiments, the mobile communication device  110  includes a slot  400  into which a secure element  130   e  is inserted. The secure element  130   e  is an example of a secure element  130   a ,  130   b,  or  130   c  ( FIGS. 3A-3C ). Even though the secure element  130   e  is physically housed within the slot  400 , the secure element  130   e  and the mobile communication device  110  still communicate wirelessly with each other. Accordingly, in some implementations the slot  400  only provides for physical insertion and mechanical connection of the secure element  130   e  to the body of the mobile communication device  110 , and does not electrically couple the secure element  130   e  to the mobile communication device  110 .  FIG. 3F  shows these various embodiments of a secure element coupled to a mobile communication device. 
       FIG. 3  illustrates one implementation of the mobile communication device  102 . The mobile communication device  102  includes a mobile application  200  that (in one implementation) is provided to the mobile communication device  102  through a remote server (e.g., management server  106 ). In one implementation, the mobile application is a Mobile Wallet application available from Blaze Mobile, of Berkeley, Calif. In one implementation, the mobile application is a hosted service, as described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/956,261, titled “Method and System for Delivering Customized Information To A Mobile Communication Device Based on User Affiliations” filed Dec. 13, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference. In one implementation, the mobile application  200  is configured to send requests to the management server for artifacts based on user input, e.g., received though a keypad (not shown) of the mobile communication device  102 . Requests to the management server  106  can also be automated, via proximity-based services, e.g., consumer tapping (or in close proximity) an LBS/contactless/RFID enabled phone against a smart poster (RFID/Bluetooth/LBS enabled, etc.), kiosk, or other device. 
     As shown in  FIG. 5 , the mobile application  200  includes a user interface  202  that is displayable on a display of the mobile communication device  102 . In one implementation, the user interface  202  is a generic user interface (or platform) that can be customized based on one or more special interest groups (SIG) that are affiliated with a user of the mobile communication device  102 . In general, the user interface  202  can be customized to display, e.g., screens, logos, messages, maps, coupons, advertisements, and other information, as discussed in greater detail below. In one implementation, a special interest group (SIG) is an organization. For example, a special interest group can be a social media group (i.e. Fans on Facebook page, followers on Twitter, followers on Youtube, friends on Linkedin, etc), university, corporation, military, government, sports team, alumni association, and the like. These (and other SIGs) generally have a need to brand and customize mobile applications they either sponsor or associate their name to. Co-branding the mobile application with well-known third party brands will facilitate community exposure, help drive consumer acceptance and adoption through viral marketing (inherent to the community) as well as marketing programs by the SIG. 
     Attention is now directed to methods of communication between various elements of the method  500  in  FIG. 8 . After a purchase is made with a mobile communication device with a secure element that enables contactless payment via induction resulting from holding the mobile communication device in proximity to a POS with NFC, the transaction information is transmitted using induction directly to the secure element and subsequently transferred to the mobile wallet for display. Alternatively, the transaction information is transferred to the management server using WIFI or the carrier network and the management server subsequently transfers it to the mobile wallet using the carrier network, WIFI etc. In either case and for all of the embodiments described in this specification, the user may have to enter a userlD and password to access their mobile wallet and view the transaction. The “Mobile Wallet PIN” which this is referred to is authenticated remotely by the management server using a carrier network. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”. 
     A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”. After logging in, the user can select or click on the icon next to the transaction with such icon representing Facebook twitter, or any other social media site ( FIG. 9 ) . After selecting the icon, the mobile wallet will automatically generate and display a customizable message to the user which includes information about the transaction such as the merchant name, merchant location, product ID, product name, cost, date of purchase, date of event, seat location, venue name, venue address, Etc ( FIG. 10 ). For event ticket purchases such as movies, the mobile wallet will generate and display a message to the user that includes the transaction details associated with the event such as event name, venue name, venue location, date time , seat location, etc ( FIG. 12 ). A user can edit the message or post it” as is” which includes information about the transaction such as the merchant name, merchant location, product ID, product name, cost, date of purchase, date of event, seat location, venue name, venue address on their Facebook page , twitter page, or any other social media page ( FIG. 13 ). Alternatively, the user can modify the canned or preformatted message and add additional text, change the canned text, delete the canned text, add a picture, etc. For an online purchase (not shown) using a mobile wallet with a secure element, the mobile wallet will generate a message of the transaction that includes the product name, merchant name, date , time , cost, etc. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site 
     In other embodiments, a user may load any credit card, debit card, checking account, savings account into their mobile wallet which enables the mobile wallet to retrieve transactions associated with these accounts from either the management server where they might be stored or the appropriate financial institution. Stated another way, the mobile wallet will display all transactions associated regardless of the payment method including NFC mobile device, SMS, WAP browser, traditional in store purchase using a magnetic stripe card, in store purchase with a contactless card, online purchase tec. If the management stores or is able to retrieve from financial institution any transaction data associated with any of these payment methods, the management server can deliver it to the mobile wallet where it can be displayed to the user. The user can also select the social media icon available for each of these transactions as well. A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”. After opening their wallet and selecting the icon next to the transaction, the mobile wallet will automatically generate and display a customizable message to the user which includes information about the transaction such as the merchant, product ID, product name, cost, date of purchase. Etc ( FIG. 10 ). A user can edit the message or post it” as is” on their Facebook page, twitter page, or any other social media page. Alternatively, the user can modify the canned or preformatted message and add additional text, change the canned text, delete the canned text, add a picture, etc. So, for example, the transaction data or receipt may include “2 tickets purchased for The Movie at the AMC on Friday night at 9 PM”, but the user may modify the canned message and add the following text “Join us for before for dinner at the Italian Restaurant on 8th”, so the message posted is “2 tickets purchased for The Movie at the AMC on Friday night at 9 PM”. Join us for dinner at the Italian Restaurant on 8 th ”. In another example, a user may purchase tickets to a ball game, take a picture while at the game and modify the canned post of 2 tickets to the ball game on Sunday at 2 PM” by adding the picture and a message such as “2 tickets to the ball game on Sunday at 2 PM . Here&#39;s a picture of the homerun”. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site 
     As shown in  FIG. 8 , a user first makes a purchase by holding their mobile communication device with an associated secure element near an NFC Point of Sale device. In doing so, the POS device triggers the payment application stored in the secure element and the payment credentials are transferred from the secure element to the POS device. The user can also hold their mobile device with associated secure element near a smart poster that has an NFC or RFID chip affixed to it to make a purchase, receive a coupon, etc. As mentioned previously, a user can also purchase an item with SMS, WAP, magnetic stripe card, online purchase, etc. In this case, the management server retrieves the transactions from the financial institution, stores the transactions, and delivers them to the mobile wallet for display. After the transaction, the POS device transfers the transaction data (e.g. receipt, ticket, coupon, etc.) to the secure element. using one of several methods described by patents referenced including U.S. Patent Application No. 61/445,667, entitled “Non-Wireless Bidirectional Communications between a Mobile Device and Associated Secure Element using An Audio Port,” filed Feb. 23, 2011, U.S. Patent Application No. 61/431,077, entitled “Non-Wireless Bidirectional Communications between a Mobile Device and Associated Secure Element,” filed Feb. 10, 2011 ,U.S. Patent Application No. 61/429,246 entitled “Wireless Bidirectional Communications between a Mobile Device and Associated Secure Element using Inaudible Sound Waves,” filed Jan. 3, 2011 , U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/948,717, entitled “Wireless Bidirectional Communications between a Mobile Device and Associated Secure Element,” filed Nov. 17, 2010, U.S. patent application Ser. No. 11/933,321, en titled “Method and System for Adapting a Wireless Mobile Communication Device for Wireless Transactions,” filed Oct. 31, 2007, and U.S. patent application Ser. No. 12/592,581, entitled “Method and Apparatus for Completing a Transaction Using a Wireless Mobile Communication Channel and Another Communication Channel,” filed Nov. 25, 2009. Alternatively, the POS device transfers the transaction data to the transaction server  170  in  FIG. 1  which then transfers it to the management server  180 . The management server transfers the transaction data to the mobile wallet and displays the transaction data to the user. This process has been described in patent filings which have been previously referred to in this specification. 
     The Mobile Wallet API determines the user&#39;s location at time of transaction and appends location to the transaction data. The user&#39;s location can be determined in a number of ways. The Mobile wallet can determine it by GPS, triangulation, or the actual location of retail merchant the user made a purchase at. In the latter case, if a user uses an NFC phone to make the purchase the POS terminal will generate a digital receipt and transmit it to the secure element directly which can subsequently be transferred to the mobile wallet. The mobile wallet can parse the digital receipt and obtain the store ID and or physical location. If the receipt simply has the store ID, the mobile wallet can transfer this to the management server which can look up the store ID and correlate it to the physical street address. Alternatively, if the POS does not transmit the receipt to the secure element, the POS can transmit it to the management server which can subsequently identify the physical store location and transmit it to the mobile wallet using the carrier network, WIFI, etc. 
     In another embodiment, a user&#39;s location can be determined by their social media login ID (e.g. twitter username, Facebook username, etc), last tweet or photo posted since tweets, Facebook posts, and digital photos in particulars have location have location information (e.g. latitude, longitude coordinates) and time for that location embedded in them. Social Media ID&#39;s may also have locations associated with users . The management server can also employ predictive algorithms to forecast a user&#39;s location based on historical data of past locations and times. 
     After opening the mobile wallet (and entering the “mobile wallet” user id and password if necessary), the user views the transaction in the wallet and posts the transaction data by pressing their finger on the social media icon for a phone that has a touch screen or clicks on the icon next to the transaction using the appropriate buttons ( FIG. 9 ). Upon selecting the transaction, the wallet SPI creates a custom message which includes the transaction data ( FIG. 10 ) and can optionally combined with the location and any other data and displays this to the user. The user can post the transaction data “as is” or modify the transaction data to include additional info which may include a promotion code for others to use as part of referral, photo of store , photo or product, photo of event, coupon, etc. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their userid and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media server for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. 
     The Mobile Wallet sends a confirmation of the post to management server including user ID/Wallet ID which may be the users 10 digit cell phone number, transaction number, location , including GPS coordinates, date, time, amount, and any other information available. The management server verifies post meets criteria by comparing the information sent with a set of criteria stored in the databases associated with the management server ( FIG. 7 ) . If post does not meet the criteria, management server sends a notification to mobile wallet user using standard wireless communication as WIFI, wireless carrier, etc. Once the mobile device receives the notification, it displays it to the user in their mobile wallet. 
     If the post meets pre-defined criteria by the management server and optionally the SIG, the management server obtains number of users who saw the post which may also be referred to as “impressions” (e.g. followers on twitter, fans on Facebook, followers on Youtube friends on Linkedin, etc) using XML, “HTTP GET”, or an API provided by the social media site, or any standard internet program. The management server also retrieves the date, time, and the actual message posted , and stores this information in the database along with user ID, transaction number. In another embodiment, a user&#39;s CPM can be determined from 3 rd  party social media rating system such as Klout which not only captures the number of followers on various social media sites, but provides a quantities value on the persons influence in reach other people, quantitative value on whether posts will be acted upon, etc. In other words, the management server may utilize a user&#39;s direct impressions; one or more quantitate values from 3 rd  party rating services, or a combination of these. Stated another way, every user is an advertiser and their “CPM” number or the number of impressions they can make are not static or limited to just their followers. A users CPM can increase over time as they obtain more followers, neutral 3 rd  party rating systems provide quantitate values that increase their clout or “impressions, and their ability to impact others to take action on their posts increase. The management server can take an average of all of these numbers, the maximum of these numbers, the weighted average of these numbers to arrive at a calibrated CPM. In other words, even though a user may have a large number of followers, their ability to affect other users to act on a post is low. In the opposite scenario, a user may have a low number of followers, but their ability to influence other users to act on a post is high. So, the management server, may provide a higher compensation the user based on their ability to influence other users to act on a post. 
       FIG. 7  illustrates one implementation of a communication system  400 . The communication system  400  includes a hand-held, wireless mobile communication device  402 , a management server  404 , a user portal  406 , and a special interest group (SIG) portal  408 . In one implementation, the management server  180  is coupled to a user and profile database  410 , an affiliate content database  412 , and an integrated marketing database  414 . In one implementation, the user and profile database  410  stores user profile information associated with each user—e.g., passwords, personal identification numbers (PINs), contact information, e-mail addresses, and the like; the affiliate content database  412  stores associations between special interest groups (SIGs) and users; the integrated marketing database  414  stores artifacts (e.g., coupons, advertising, tickets, etc.) that can be sent to a user; the social media web pages include Twitter, Facebook, MySpace, etc.; The social media partners include partners that participate in providing compensation to users for their posts such as merchants, product manufacturers, reward card programs, coupon vendors such as Groupon, etc. 
     The management server uses all of the transaction information, location information as well as information from the user and profile database  410  in  FIG. 7 , integrated marketing database  414  in  FIG. 7 , and the affiliate content database  412  in  FIG. 7 . to determine the reward to give to user based on number of impressions (e.g. followers on twitter, fans on Facebook, etc.), number of previous posts by the user, significance of previous posts as measured by new posts generated or ratings by 3 rd  party systems such as Klout, location of purchase, merchant item was purchased by, transaction amount, payment method (e.g. using NFC, SMS, WAP, traditional card), previous transaction history, number of new posts generated by the post (e.g. “Retweets”), etc. If necessary, management server contacts appropriate participating partners  430  (e.g. merchant, product manufacturer, financial institution, loyalty provider, etc) to determine and provide compensation to the user in the form of a digital artifact which includes but not limited to debit/prepaid/credit card, receipts, tickets, advertisements, coupons, loyalty points, gift cards, vouchers, content (video, image, ringtone, movie), games, documentation, etc. 
     The management server transmits compensation (e.g. coupons , additional loyalty points, additional funds, etc) to the mobile wallet using wireless carrier, WIFI, etc over the second communications channel defined in patent filings referenced herein. The mobile wallet API transfers coupons, points, funds, tickets, etc. to the secure element using the wireless or non-wireless methods described previously in section. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011”. Mobile Wallet sends notification to management server of transfer of promotion 
     In another embodiment, the user may include a referral number or promotion code in their transaction related post (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) to their Special Interest Group (e.g. fans on Facebook, followers on twitter , or any members affiliated with a social media group). If any one of the members of the SIG utilizes this code during an in-store purchase with their mobile wallet and associated secure element, online purchase using their mobile wallet, smart poster or some other transaction using their mobile wallet and associated secure element, their transaction is automatically registered by the management server with the referral code, date, time, amount of transaction, etc. The management server will determine if the user who placed the original transaction related post with the promotion code will receive some compensation such as points, coupons, money, ticket, etc. If the compensation is a coupon, ticket, or additional money, the mobile wallet will transfer the compensation digitally to the secure element or to the mobile wallet using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     Members of the SIG who refer to the promo code during their transaction using their mobile communication device with an associated secure element will also receive additional compensation for the purchase as well as any social media posts that the conduct. This is accomplished when the user enters the promo code in their mobile wallet and the mobile wallet transfers the promo code to the secure element. The promo code is then utilized like a coupon such that when the user holds their mobile communication device near the NFC POS, the POS device applies a discount or the appropriate compensation related to the promotion to the purchase. If the user posts the transaction based on using the referral code on a social media site, the management server will determine additional compensation to the user (in the form of a digital artifact which includes but not limited to debit/prepaid/credit card, receipts, tickets, advertisements, coupons, loyalty points, gift cards, vouchers, content (video, image, ringtone, movie), games, documentation, etc.) and transfer compensation to their mobile wallet which will transfer it to the secure element or the mobile wallet using methods reference previously in this specification. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WWI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     In another embodiment, the user can post a transaction directly on television or on a social media site where it is subsequently posted on television. A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”. After opening the mobile wallet if the mobile wallet user places a transaction related post (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) on a social media site “as is” or a modified version and the transaction related post is broadcast on television, the mobile wallet user must notify the management server about the post, time, date, and TV program as well as provide proof of the post. The user can notify the management server via the user web portal  406  in  FIG. 7 . Alternatively, the user can use an API in the mobile wallet to submit this information to the management server. The management server will determine the number of impressions (i.e. number of viewers) and number of new posts generated by that post (e.g. “Retweets”) at that time and provide any necessary compensation. Alternatively, the TV program may transfer the post electronically to the management server using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc. If the compensation is a coupon, ticket, or additional funds, the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element or mobile wallet using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously in this specification. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WWI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     In another embodiment, a user may post a transaction on a social media site and it is subsequently printed in a magazine, newspaper, or other printed medium. A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”.). If the mobile wallet user places a transaction related (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) on a social media site and the post is printed in a magazine, newspaper, or some other printed medium, the mobile wallet user must notify the management server about the post, time, date, and publication as well as provide proof of the post using either the user portal  406  or an API in the mobile wallet. The management server will determine the number of impressions (i.e. number of readers) of the printed media at that time , number of new posts generated from the post (e.g. “Retweets”) and provide any necessary compensation either via traditional means such as mailing a check or electronically to the mobile wallet or the secure element. Alternatively, the printed publication may transfer the post electronically to the management server which transfers it to the mobile wallet. If the compensation is a digital artifact which includes but not limited to debit/prepaid/credit card, receipts, tickets, advertisements, coupons, loyalty points, gift cards, vouchers, content (video, image, ringtone, movie), games, documentation, etc.), the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13,184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     In another embodiment, a user&#39;s post on a social media site is printed on a bill board or poster . A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”. If the user places a transaction related post (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) “as is” or a modified version on a social media site and the post is incorporated into a bill board or poster located on a bus, train, building, etc. the user must notify the management server provider about the post, time, date, and location well as provide proof of the post. The management server will determine the number of impressions (i.e. readers of bill board or poster) at that time and provide any necessary compensation via traditional means such as mailing a check or electronically to the mobile wallet or the secure element. Alternatively, the transit agency may transfer the post electronically to the management server which transmits the compensation to the mobile wallet using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc. If the compensation is a coupon, ticket, or additional funds, the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously in this specification. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. Patent Application No. 61/442,384, titled U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     In another embodiment, a user&#39;s post to a social media site may be printed or displayed on a smart poster which is a poster that is equipped with an RFID or NFC tag that is encoded with information that can be “read” by an NFC enabled device. A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”.). If the user places a transaction related post (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) “as is” or a modified version on a social media site and the post is incorporated into a smart poster (a poster that has an RFID tag affixed to it, encoded with information such as a coupon, URL, ticket, etc and that can be read by any RFID reader including a mobile device that has an NFC chip, smart sticker, NFC on SD, or NFC on SIM, etc), the user must notify the management server about the post, time, date, and location well as provide proof of the post. The management server will determine the number of impressions and will also track the number of times that the RFID tag associated with the smart poster was “read” and then number of new postings (e.g. “Retweets”) that were generated by other users who used their mobile wallet to read the tag and to place a post their social media page. The management server will transmit the compensation (in the form of a digital artifact which includes but not limited to debit/prepaid/credit card, receipts, tickets, advertisements, coupons, loyalty points, gift cards, vouchers, content (video, image, ringtone, movie), games, documentation, etc.) directly to the secure element or to the mobile wallet using the wireless carrier network or WWI. Alternatively, the owner of the smart poster may transfer the post electronically to the management server. The management server will determine the compensation. If the compensation is a coupon, ticket, or additional finds, the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously in this specification. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc. Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     In a preferred embodiment, a user&#39;s post to a social media site may be displayed on a website. A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”.). If the user places a transaction related post (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) “as is” or a modified version on a social media site and the post is displayed on a website, the user must notify the management server about the post, time, date, and location well as provide proof of the post. The management server will determine the number of impressions and will measure the website traffic including but not limited to the number of impressions or hits on the website, the number of times that the post was “read” and then number of new postings or “retweets” that were generated by the post. The management server will transmit the compensation (in the form of a digital artifact which includes but not limited to debit/prepaid/credit card, receipts, tickets, advertisements, coupons, loyalty points, gift cards, vouchers, content (video, image, ringtone, movie), games, documentation, etc.) directly to the secure element or to the mobile wallet using the wireless carrier network or WIFI. Alternatively, the owner of the web site may transfer the post electronically to the management server. The management server will determine the compensation. If the compensation is a coupon, ticket, or additional funds, the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously in this specification. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc. Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     In a final embodiment, a user&#39;s post to a social media site may be printed on an article of clothing such as a t-shirt, baseball cap, jacket, headband, sweater, pants, etc. A user opens their mobile wallet and enters their userid and password if necessary which is authenticated by the remote management server. If the user logins to the mobile wallet using their social media ID and password, the user is first authenticated by the management server which then transmits the login credentials to the social media server for authentication. So, the user is logged into both the mobile wallet and the social media site automatically which is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”.). If the user places a transaction related post (i.e. a post based on transactions from using the secure element associated with their mobile device for payments or any other transaction associated with the financial accounts registered in their mobile wallet) “as is” or a modified version on a social media site and the post is printed on an article of clothing, the user must notify the management server about the post, time, date, and location well as provide proof of the post. The management server will determine the number of impressions the post hasand then number of new postings or “retweets” that were generated by the post. The management server will transmit the compensation (in the form of a digital artifact which includes but not limited to debit/prepaid/credit card, receipts, tickets, advertisements, coupons, loyalty points, gift cards, vouchers, content (video, image, ringtone, movie), games, documentation, etc.) directly to the secure element or to the mobile wallet using the wireless carrier network or WIFI. Alternatively, the owner of the clothing may transfer evidence of the post electronically to the management server. The management server will determine the compensation. If the compensation is a coupon, ticket, or additional funds, the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings referenced previously in this specification. Prior to the post, the mobile wallet may prompt the user to enter their id and password for the social media site if authorization is required and “single sign in” is not available meaning that the mobile wallet user id and password used to access the mobile wallet is not the same as the social media userid and password. If the mobile wallet prompts the user for their social media user id and password, the mobile wallet transmits this to the social media site for authentication using the wireless carrier network, WIFI, etc . Upon successful authentication, the user is able to post the message on the social media site. If the secure element is locked, the management server may have to unlock it per the methods described in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 13/184,209 entitled “Method and Systems of loading and unloading digital artifacts between a mobile device with an associated secure element and other remote devices” filed Jul. 15, 2011. 
     To reiterate, a user may post a transaction to a social media site as long as the transaction is displayed in their mobile wallet regardless of whether the purchase was conducted using an NFC enabled device, SMS, WAP, traditional magnetic striped card, online, etc. When a mobile wallet user logins into their wallet, the management server will determine if they are members of a SIG (e.g. fans on Facebook page, followers on Twitter, etc). If a user logins to their mobile wallet using their twitter userlD, Facebook userid, or any other social media or SIG userlD, the user credentials (ie. User ID and password) are securely passed from the mobile wallet to the management server which authenticates the user at the SIG&#39;s portal. In doing so, the user is not only given access to the mobile wallet, but they are also automatically logged into their SIG. This is sometimes referred to as “single sign on”. In this scenario, once a user is logged into their mobile wallet using their social media ID/password, they can select to post a message to a social media site and not have to provide their id/password again to confirm the post. Stated another way, if the user does not login to the mobile wallet using their social media id/password, they may be prompted to enter this information prior to actually posting a message to the social media site. As shown in  FIG. 5 , the mobile application  200  includes a user interface  202  that is displayable on a display of the mobile communication device  102 . 
     In one implementation, the user interface  202  is a generic user interface (or platform) that can be customized based on one or more special interest groups (SIG) that are affiliated with a user of the mobile communication device  102 . In general, the user interface  202  can be customized to display, e.g., screens, logos, messages, maps, coupons, advertisements, and other information, as discussed in greater detail below. In one implementation, a special interest group (SIG) is an organization. For example, a special interest group can be members of a social network (i.e fans on Facebook, followers on twitter, followers on YouTube, friends on Linkedin, etc) a university, corporation, military, government, sports team, alumni association, and the like. These (and other SIGs) generally have a need to brand and customize mobile applications they either sponsor or associate their name to. Co-branding the mobile application with well-known third party brands will facilitate community exposure, help drive consumer acceptance and adoption through viral marketing (inherent to the community) as well as marketing programs by the SIG. 
     Usually, the format used by the mobile application  200  remains reasonably constant over time in contrast to content, which typically changes on a regular basis based on time and the SIG. In one implementation, as content changes on a regular basis, a SIG uploads only the new content to the management server (e.g., management server  180 ). Accordingly, when the mobile application  200  next accesses the content of the management server  180 , the management server  180  uploads the new (customized SIG) content (and format if applicable) to the mobile application  200 . Subsequent uploads to the mobile application  200  can include only content since the format, in one implementation, is cached on the mobile communication device  102  after the first download. If the SIG desires to change the format at a subsequent time, the next upload to the mobile application  200  can include both the new layout format and any new content. If applicable content is a coupon, ticket, or additional funds, the mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings which have been referenced previously in this specification. 
       FIG. 6  illustrates a method  300  for customizing a mobile application (e.g., mobile application  200 ) running on a mobile communication device. (e.g., mobile communication device  102 ). A mobile application having a generic platform is provided to a mobile communication device of a user (step  302 ). In one implementation, the mobile application is provided to the mobile communication device through a network—e.g., a public network (e.g., the Internet), a private network, or a voice communications network. The generic platform can comprise a generic user interface having default screens, controls, and/or logos. A determination is made (e.g., by management server  106 ) of one or more special interest groups (SIGs) that are associated with the user (step  304 ). In one implementation, the management server  306  queries a database (e.g., an affiliate content database) to determine which special interest groups (SIGs) that a given user is associated with. The generic platform of the mobile application is customized based on one or more of the special interest groups (SIGs) that are associated with the user (step  306 ). 
     In one implementation, association between a SIG and an end user is validated via an out-of-band process—e.g., a banking customer may have to specify their SIG and provide their SIG credentials (e.g., online banking userID/password) that are unique to the SIG. The management server validates the credentials with the SIG. Once the end user has been authenticated by the SIG, it will be possible to deliver the SIG&#39;s branding and messaging specifically to the end user. Such a technique minimizes the number of applications that need to be executed by a mobile communication device. For example, a single mobile application can be customized by a large number of different special interest groups (SIGs). In one implementation, the mobile application can be customized to display different screens, user interfaces and/or controls. Less memory is, therefore, required by a mobile communication device in order to support applications required by multiple special interest groups (SIGs) 
     To enable the branding and customization of the mobile application (e.g., the mobile wallet application) running on the mobile communication device  402 , in one implementation, various screens are designed based on meta-data (i.e., meta-data delivered (pulled or pushed) to the mobile communication device  402  based on the SIG). The core wallet screen can be the same for all subscribers—e.g., a login screen for all subscribers can have the same pre-defined format (controlling how content is displayed and permitted actions), and only the content is dynamically generated. The following screens, or category of screens, include (but are not limited to):
     Logo—A community logo will display upon wallet launch. If a customer is not affiliated with a SIG, the default Blaze logo will be displayed.   Watermark—An almost transparent watermark image that does not to conflict with maps, wallpaper, etc.   Advertisements—Local advertisements from the community will be displayed instead of or in addition to general advertisements. If a customer is not affiliated with a SIG, general advertisements will be displayed.   Coupons—Coupons from the local community will be displayed instead of or in addition to general coupons. If a customer is not affiliated with a SIG, general coupons will be displayed. The mobile wallet will transfer them to the secure element using methods described in previous patent filings which have been referenced previously in this specification.   Events—Community events will be displayed. If a customer is not affiliated with a SIG, general events will be displayed such as information about Blaze Mobiles new wallet features, etc.   Alerts—Community alerts will be displayed. If a customer is not affiliated with a SIG, general alerts will be displayed.   Maps—A map which shows the physical location of members of a SIG.   

     In some cases, a special interest group (SIG) may be involved in the content approval process. In such an implementation, in order to deliver meta-data to the mobile communication device based on input from the SIG, the end-user&#39;s account (e.g., walletID, etc.) is associated with a SIG. The SIG will access a portal (web-based or otherwise) (e.g., SIG portal  408 ) that enables the SIG to control, publish, etc., content associated to the SIG on the management server  404 . In one implementation, one or more screens queries the management server  404  for dynamic content (media, text, logo, sort order, etc.). The query can include (but is not limited to) the end-users walletID. Using a look-up table in the management server  404  or the affiliate content database  412 , it is possible to determine the associated SIG. The management server  404  can then internally determine the appropriate content (including media, etc.) to respond to the mobile application running on the mobile communication device  402 . These result sets can be cached on the mobile communication device  402  for future use to improve performance (as needed). 
     Integrated Mobile Marketing Insertion In one implementation, an advertising manager application running on the management server  404  inserts advertisements (based on advertisement insertion order) into Ad Engine (or 3rdParty Ad Delivery platform). The advertising manager application specifies specific advertisements with targeting parameters of SIGs (among other targeting parameters as specified by, e.g., an advertising agency) and displays these ads in the mobile application 
     Integrated Mobile Marketing (Advertising and Coupons) Delivery In one implementation, advertising and/or coupons can be sent to a mobile application based on one or more special interest groups (SIGs) that a user is affiliated with. In one implementation, an end user registers affiliation with a special interest group (SIG) through a web portal (e.g., user portal  406 ). The management server  180  can validate the affiliation out-of-band. The end user logs into mobile application, and the mobile application queries the management server  404  for any advertisements or coupons by providing a screenID (a unique screen identifier). The management server  404  determines that the user has an affiliation to a special interest group (SIG) and appends the SIGID (a unique SIG identifier) to the target parameters. A query including the targeting parameters is forwarded to an advertising engine (or 3rdParty). The advertising engine responds with the appropriate URL to the advertising object that best meets the advertising criteria (e.g. age, gender, geographic location, proximity to retail store, shopping list, transaction history, etc). In one implementation, the mobile application queries advertisements based on the URL returned.  FIG. 15  illustrates example advertisements/coupons that can be displayed through a mobile wallet application running on a mobile communication device. 
     Alerts and Notification In one implementation, alerts and notifications can be sent to a mobile application based on one or more special interest groups (SIGs) that a user is affiliated with. In one implementation, a notification manager application running on the management server  180  inserts alerts (based on an insertion order) into a notification engine associated with the management server  404  (or a third party notification delivery platform). The notification manager application associates the notifications (text, etc.) with one or more SIGIDs (among other targeting parameters as specified by, e.g., an advertising agency). In one implementation, the notification engine queries the user and profile database  410 , and determines a list of walletIDs (of end users) that match the target delivery criteria. For each end-user identified, the management server  180  determines a notification mode (e.g., SMS/text messaging, e-mail, or both) and a delivery window (time of day, etc.). These criteria are used to send the notification (or alerts) to the end-user.  FIG. 8  illustrates example alerts and notifications that can be displayed through a mobile application running on a mobile communication device. 
     SIG Location maps In one implementation, members of a SIG can see locations of other members on a map based on one or more special interest groups (SIGs) that a user is affiliated with. The users location is based on the GPS coordinates . In one implementation, and end user registers affiliation with a special interest group (SIG) through a web portal (e.g., user portal  406 ). The management server  180  can validate the affiliation of the user to the special interest group (SIG) out-of-band. The end user logs into the mobile application, and the mobile application queries the management server  180  for locations of all SIG members or certain members selected by the user.. The management server  180  determines the locations of the SIG members when SIG members login using the mobile wallet and elect to have their GPS coordinates uploaded to the management server. The management server responds to the query with a list of members of the special interest group (SIG) and displays them on a map with The map is cached in a memory of the mobile communication device  402 , and the mobile application running on the mobile communication device  402  displays the SIG map. 
     One or more of method steps described above can be performed by one or more programmable processors executing a computer program to perform functions by operating on input data and generating output. Generally, the invention can take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment or an embodiment containing both hardware and software elements. In one implementation, the invention is implemented in software, which includes but is not limited to firmware, resident software, microcode, etc. Furthermore, the invention can take the form of a computer program product accessible from a computer-usable or computer-readable medium providing program code for use by or in connection with a computer or any instruction execution system. For the purposes of this description, a computer-usable or computer readable medium can be any apparatus that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. The medium can be an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system (or apparatus or device) or a propagation medium. Examples of a computer-readable medium include a semiconductor or solid state memory, magnetic tape, a removable computer diskette, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), a rigid magnetic disk and an optical disk. Current examples of optical disks include compact disk—read only memory (CD-ROM), compact disk—read/write (CD-R/W) and DVD. 
     The method  500  thus allows for using a mobile communication&#39;s device and associated secure element to make purchases, transfer of transaction data to mobile wallet, posting transaction data from the mobile wallet n a social media site , and rewarding users for their marketing efforts. While the method  500  includes a number of operations that appear to occur in a specific order, it should be apparent that the method  500  can include more or fewer operations, which can be executed serially or in parallel. An order of two or more operations may be changed and two or more operations may be combined into a single operation.
