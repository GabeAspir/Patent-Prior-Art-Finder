The dimming control element may comprise a switch such as a FET, BJT, relay, or any other type of switching device, for example, and provides control for activation and deactivation of the load. The feedback means is coupled to the voltage conversion element and a current sensing element and provides a feedback signal to the voltage conversion element that is indicative of the voltage drop across the current sensing element which thus represents the current flowing through the load. The current sensing element may comprise a fixed resistor, variable resistor, inductor, or some other element which has a predictable voltage-current relationship and thus will provide a measurement of the current flowing through the load based on a collected voltage signal. Based on the feedback signal received, the voltage conversion means can subsequently adjust its output voltage such that a constant switched current is provided to the load.",

The players bid their hands in accordance with the normal sequence of bidding used in the game of bridge and if any player makes an incorrect bid, the next succeeding bidder can consult his bid chart and inform the prior bidder whether or not he has made an incorrect bid. The prior bidder can then try again to make the correct bid or eventually be told what the bid should be. Once the bidding is complete, the opening leader selects his lead and if the lead is incorrect he can be corrected by the player on whose chart the opening lead is indicated, usually the declarer.",

The relay is energized first by a current level (amperage) and then latches into an energized mode by voltage, necessarily in that order. The auxiliary start capacitor is electrically connected to the motor circuit in parallel to the start and run winding by two non-polarized leads and in series with the current sensing coil. The voltage sensing coil is connected across the normally closed contacts and senses no voltage as long as the contacts are closed. As the motor gains speed (RPM), the current (amperage) increase through the current sensing coil and when it reaches a preset threshold, the current sensing coil opens the contacts which have a voltage across them when opening which voltage is sensed by the voltage sensing coil of the relay and latches the relay contacts open until power to the motor is removed. The components and circuitry are enclosed in a housing which may be easily mounted on a suitable surface in close proximity to the motor.

Starting with an auto-collimation process which determines the inclination of this boundary area in relation to a reference axis from the deviation of a light beam collimated onto the boundary area to be investigated and reflected on a position-sensitive photodetection system, a twin-beam interferometer process with downstream evaluation electronics is provided which permits the separation of the interferogram, intensity-modulated according to the invention, of the boundary area to be investigated from the unmodulated disturbance reflections of those not to be investigated as far as the interferogram intensities in the photon-noise range and thus offers a resolution in the deviation of the center of gravity of the interferogram of the order of 10 nm. To modulate the intensity of the interferogram, the difference in the optical distance between the reference and test beams to the boundary area to be investigated is time-modulated.",

A gas component detecting element composed of a semiconductive metal oxide is contacted by the exhaust gas andexhibits variable electric resistances according to the concentrations of the gas components. The electric resistance is taken out as an electric signal through two electrodes disposed either on the surface of the detecting element exposed to the exhaust gas or within the detecting element adjacent that exposed surface. A porous coating layer having an exhaust gas permeability covers the surface of the detecting element exposed to the exhaust gas so as to prevent poisonous substances contained in the exhaust gas from depositing on that exposed surface of the detecting element. The coating layer is formed of a metal oxide having electrically insulating properties and carries therein a catalyst promoting an oxidation reaction of the exhaust gas. The detecting element exhibits an abruptly changed electric resistance when the actual air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture supplied into the combustion device is deviated from a stoichiometrical air-fuel ratio, thereby enabling the control of the air-fuel ratio of the air-fuel mixture.",

    "abstract_en": "A circuit is incorporated into an electronically tuned radio receiver for eliminating rundown noise. As the power supply voltage in an electronically tuned radio receiver declines, the radio does not merely fade away, it also has its tuning swept thereby producing an undesirable sound, herein termed &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;rundown noise.&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; This can occur in electronically tuned solid state radio receivers that employ very large power supply filter capacitors which will operate the radio for a short period of time after the primary power supply has been terminated. In automotive systems the existence of an electric-motor-containing accessory, such as a heater or air conditioner, may produce rundown noise. If the motor is running while the radio is in operation, turning the ignition switch off removes power to the system but the electric motor, while coasting to a stop, acts as a d-c generator thereby supplying a declining voltage to the radio. The circuit of this invention terminates radio operation abruptly when the power supply voltage drops below a predetermined value.",

Unlike prior art designs where such changes are caused by variations in the plate separation distance, in the design of the present invention the plate separation distance is fixed, it being the effective plate area that changes with acceleration. A key feature is that the basic unit is a pair of capacitors. The fixed plates in each case are at the same relative height but the mobile plates are offset relative to the fixed plates, one mobile plate somewhat higher than its fixed plate with the other mobile plate being somewhat lower. Then, when the mobile plates move (in the same direction), one capacitor increases in value while the other decreases by the same amount. This differential design renders the device insensitive to sources of systematic error such as temperature changes. A process for manufacturing the design is described.",

    "abstract_en": "A method and apparatus for indirectly measuring the percentage of dissolved gas in a process liquid by injecting bubbles of the same kind of gas of predetermined diameter into the liquid to be measured and then measuring gas bubble life or survival time. Bubble lifetime is directly related to dissolved gas percentage. A relatively long gas bubble lifetime would be indicative of a highly saturated or poorly degassed process liquid, whereas a relatively short bubble lifetime would be indicative of a low degree of saturation or a well degassed process liquid. In one embodiment, dissolved gas percentage is determined by placing a small quantity of the process liquid into a container, injecting a burst of gas bubbles, of predetermined size, into this quantity of liquid, and then measuring gas bubble lifetime. In another embodiment, a portion of the liquid being measured is continuously routed through a tube at a known constant flow rate. A continuous series of individual bubbles are then injected into the transparent tube, at a fairly constant rate, at or near the bottom thereof. The maximum distance attained by a bubble within the transparent tube before disappearing from view is a direct indication of the percentage of dissolved gas in the liquid being measured.",

If a vacuum can be created in a container, this indicates that the container has a leak. Conversely if a vacuum cannot be created in the container, this indicates that the container does not have a leak. The leak detection system preferably includes a conveyor system for moving a container and a sensor for sensing the pressure in the interior of the container through an opening in the top of the container. While the sensor is sensing the pressure in the interior of the container, a vacuum pump pulls air from the region around the exterior of the container. If the container has an aperture, a vacuum will be created in the container and will be noted by the sensor. Conversely, if the container does not have an aperture, a vacuum will not be created within the container and the sensor will determine this by noting that the pressure of the container is above a predetermined pressure limit. This sensor determines that the container has an aperture by noting that the vacuum in the container is greater in magnitude than a predetermined pressure limit. The leak detection system of this invention may further include a reject assembly for rejecting a container that is detected by the sensor to have an aperture and a controller for controlling the reject assembly in response to signals from the sensor.",

Inputs are pixel plane coordinates and intensity of target blips. The Intelligent Target Tracking Processor (ITTP) employs an optimal target tracking algorithm. An optimal observation-to-track assignment exists when all target blips in a new frame of target data are matched up with nearby tracks, such that the sum of all the distances from each target blip to its assigned track is minimized. An expert system is used to control overall processing flow and provide efficient allocation of computing resources. Target blips without near neighbors are allowed to go directly to a real track table of established tracks, if their coordinates match-up with projected tracking gates. Otherwise, target blips are tested sequentially against two-frame, three-frame, and four- or higher-frame discriminants, to reject blips not belonging to established tracks. The ITTP can partition the pixel plane into &#34;bite size partitions&#34;, each with a manageable number of target blips, which it handles sequentially. The ITTP is designed to handle hundreds or thousands of targets as a stand-alone processor as is required in space object tracking or military scenarios. The expert system maintains an optimum balance between correlating on existing tracks and discriminating against impossible tracks. A total of 26 different metric and radiometric target tracking discriminants are employed. The ITTP is a dynamically and optimally configured set of general purpose parallel processors.",

    "abstract_en": "An electro-optical ranging system is disclosed for purposes of measuring or determining the distance from a transmitting/receiving location to an object, such as a target. An electro-optical transducer, such as a laser diode, is employed which exhibits the characteristic of emitting radiant energy in the infrared region when driven into a conductive condition and also exhibits the characteristic of being in a photovoltaic condition in response to receipt of radiant energy within the wavelength of the energy emitted. The transducer is periodically driven so as to emit radiant energy, and an optical directing means, such as an optical lens system, is employed for purposes of directing emitted energy from the transducer along a path toward the target as well as for receiving energy traveling in the opposite direction from the target and directing the received energy so as to impinge upon the transducer such that the transducer is actuated to a photovoltaic condition. An output circuit provides a first pulse each time the transducer is driven into conduction and a second output pulse each time the transducer is actuated into the photovoltaic conduction by received radiant energy. In this way, the time duration from the first pulse to the second pulse provides a representation of the distance of the target from the transducer.",

    "abstract_en": "A method of measuring the length of a lap joint between sheets of material comprises the steps of transporting the sheets over a first roll and under a second roll. The rolls are a fixed distance apart. A first signal is generated when a second end of a first sheet passes a first measuring point which is located above the first roll. A second signal is generated when a first end of the second sheet passes a second measuring point which is located under the second roll. The number of revolutions of the first roll between the first and second signal are counted by a rotary encoder associated with the first roll. By comparing the actual number of pulses counted by the rotary encoder with a reference number of pulses which is determined by the number of the rotations of the first roll necessary to transport a given point from the measuring point above the first roll to the measuring point below the second roll, a length of a lap joint can be calculated. The calculation requires the subtracting of the actual number of pulses from the reference number of pulses, and converting the difference in pulses to a length measurement. An apparatus for carrying out the method comprises first, second and third rolls. At least one of the rolls has a rotary encoder associated therewith. A first sensor is located above the first roll and a second sensor is located below the second roll.",

Alternatively, an operation state of the vehicle by the driver is detected and if the detection result does not satisfy a predetermined condition, the set value of the TTC is increased. For example, the predetermined condition indicates the normal state of the driving by the driver. Alternatively, when the condition indicating the normality of driving by the driver is satisfied, the number of stages is reduced.

Lower power versions of the unit (115v.) employ a chopper inverter circuit utilizing a single SCR and feedback diode pair as the power controlling element of the circuit and higher power versions (230v.) use two such SCR/diode pairs connected in series for converting direct current potential to a high frequency pulsating excitation potential that is supplied to the induction heating coil of the unit. The pan safety control feature senses whether the conduction interval of the SCR/diode pair falls within preset limits which normally would occur with a pan of suitable conductivity characteristics being heated by the coil. Under conditions where a high conductivity pan such as aluminum or copper is employed, the conduction interval of the single SCR and diode pair will be shortened under conditions where the circuit has been running and the high conductivity pan is brought into proximity with the inductive heating coil. Under these conditions, the pan safety control circuit senses the shortened conduction interval of the SCR and feedback diode pair and shuts down the chopper inverter. A second situation that can occur is where the high conductivity pan is physically disposed over the inductive heating coil at the time of initial turn-on of the induction cooking unit. Under these conditions the pan safety control senses a prolonged conduction interval falling outside a preset limit and similarly shuts down the chopper inverter.",

Furthermore, any scar left by the procedure tends to extend in a direction that is parallel to the uterine wall, and thus is less likely to propagate and cause rupture of the uterine wall during pregnancy.",

The diameter may be expanded by an amount that ranges from a fraction to a multiple of the original diameter of the borehole. In this fashion, geological formations containing oil, gas or groundwater which were previously uneconomical to produce may be worked into a condition of economical production. In a preferred embodiment, the borehole reamer is formed as an elongated assembly having an outside diameter which is sized to fit within a diameter of a conventional borehole. The assembly is preferably attached to drill pipe and lowered into a borehole to an appropriate depth corresponding to a pay zone of interest. A lower portion of the assembly, which is located at the deeper depth in the borehole, is constructed in the form of a bellows which functions as a pilot/anchor for the assembly. A group of deployable cutting elements are disposed above the bellows and below a sliding power transfer unit which forms the upper portion of the assembly and attaches to a drill stem.",

Immediate blood flow restoration advantageously can facilitate natural lysis of the clot and also can reduce or obviate the concern for distal embolization due to fragmentation of the clot. Several embodiments of the invention provide for progressive, or modular, treatment based upon the nature of the clot. For example, the progressive treatment can comprise a three-step progressive treatment process that includes immediate restoration of blood flow, in-situ clot management, and/or clot removal depending on the particular circumstances of the treatment.

In particular, a genome wide probe map can be generated by obtaining a plurality of detectable oligonucleotide probes hybridized to at least one double stranded nucleic acid molecule cleaved with at least one restriction enzyme, and detecting the location of the detectable oligonucleotide probes. For example, genome wide haplotype sequence can be generated by analyzing at least one genome wide restriction map in conjunction with at least one genome wide probe map to determine distances between restriction sites of the at least one genome wide restriction map and locations of detectable oligonucleotide probes of the at least one genome wide probe map and defining a consensus map indicating restriction sites based on each of the at least one genome wide restriction map and locations of detectable oligonucleotide probes based on each of the at least one genome wide probe map.",

In addition, weights and/or flywheels may be used to smooth the oscillations. When the two platforms are side-by-side, the elastic elements run in a substantially crosswise direction. A seated user may place the user&#39;s feet on the platforms and move his/her feet and lower legs back and forth in a scissoring motion to move the platforms in opposing directions along the rails. In so doing, the user overcomes the resistance of the elastic elements and dampers connecting the platforms. This provides the user with exercise and its accompanying benefits.",

The agglomerator utilizes a rotary blade assembly (100) that repeatedly impacts and cuts the wet mixture of material to be agglomerated, which is forced radially outward through the blade assembly under centrifugal and air pressure force. Wet granules pass through an annular screen (104) where they reach a predetermined maximum size. The dryer has an inlet (50) for wet granules from the agglomerator, an outlet (78) for granules having passed through the dryer, and one or more baffles (64) within the dryer defining a spiral path through which the granules pass from the dryer inlet towards the dryer outlet. The baffles are configured such that their pitch increases with distance from the dryer inlet, whereby the cross-sectional area of the spiral path increases toward the dryer outlet.",

    "abstract_en": "Apparatus and a concomitant method of providing a technique, within each central office (CO) in a digital CO cluster, for translating a destination number for a signaling message into a destination point code. Such a CO generally contains a switching system, for providing an interface to various station lines (telephone lines) and links to other DCOs, and/or an A-link consolidator (ALC), and an SS7 signaling processing system for providing a software based control system to properly format, address and route signaling messages. Through the invention, the SS7 signaling processing system first translates a destination number into a destination point code. The destination point code is then incorporated into a signaling message. The signaling message is subsequently routed to a destination node that corresponds to the destination point code. The destination point code indicates either a CO within the cluster or an STP outside of the cluster. Advantageously, use of the invention eliminates the need to translate the destination number into the destination point code without accessing an SS7 node outside of the CO cluster.",

    "abstract_en": "A training and strengthening device for throwing sports that uses aerodynamic drag to create a velocity-dependent resistance force on an athlete&#39;s throwing or swinging hand substantially throughout the entire training motion. The resistance force produced on the device from aerodynamic drag can be used as a sensitive indicator of throwing or swinging efficacy. The device, which is portable, is wholly hand-held, untethered to any grounding surface, requires no one other than the athlete to use, and allows a fast-paced repetitive workout. An embodiment of the invention is designed to be close in weight to a regulation baseball and allows a throwing motion very similar to pitching a baseball. An embodiment of the element for producing aerodynamic resistive drag is comprised of a lightweight foam structure attached to a poly baseball via a flexible strap. The foam structure is preferably formed by four equally spaced foam fins emanating out from a central axis, wide at one end and tapering to a conical point at the other end. A foam circular plate is attached to the wide end of the fins creating four elongated corner cube pockets designed to trap air while the device is in motion to produce a large drag coefficient for the given volume of the device.",

The printed wiring board includes a coreless substrate which includes: a dielectric layer having a main surface and a connecting pad embedded in the dielectric layer. The connecting pad is shaped like a brimmed hat. That is, the connecting pad includes a plate portion whose diameter φ 1  is about 95 μm and a contact portion whose diameter φc is about 75 μm. The main surface of the contact portion is exposed at the main surface of the dielectric layer. Since diameter φc of the contact portion is substantially the same as diameter φ 2  of an under bump metal at the semiconductor chip side, even if mechanical stress is applied in a direction in which the semiconductor chip is peeled off from the coreless substrate, the stress disperses evenly to both of the connecting pad and the under bump metal, and thus rupture is less prone to occur.",

    "abstract_en": "A double-acting regeneratively controlled piston-cylinder device or tilt cylinder for tilting a spring-supported truck cab relative to the truck chassis to permit access to the truck engine positioned below the cab embodies means therein which enable slight relative reciprocating movement of the piston and cylinder from an &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;at rest&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39; position in response to slight relative bouncing movement of the cab with respect to the chassis as the truck operates over-the-road. The piston-cylinder device is of the double-acting type and embodies means to provide an oil passage around the piston over part of the piston stroke. The oil passage may take the form of a concentric chamber, an eccentric chamber, a helical groove, or a longitudinal groove, each formed in the cylinder wall or may be a separate tube on the cylinder for by-passing the piston. Relative piston-cylinder motion results because, if the piston is pushed inwardly of the cylinder by cab bounce, oil can escape from the base end of the cylinder via the passage to the rod end of the cylinder. Or, if the piston is pulled outwardly of the cylinder by cab bounce, oil can flow from the rod end of the cylinder via the passage to the base end of the cylinder.",

    "abstract_en": "A DRAM-compatible nonvolatile memory includes a FLASH memory and a logic controller. The logical controller accepts conventional DRAM command protocol and accepts data and addresses from DRAM data and address buses, respectively. The logic controller responds to repeated CAS-before-RAS signals and a write enable signal to initiate block erases and writes to the FLASH memory. The nonvolatile, DRAM-compatible memory is incorporated in a package having the same pin structure as a conventional DRAM package, such that the nonvolatile, DRAM-compatible memory can be mounted in a DRAM mount, such as a socket. Because the nonvolatile, DRAM-compatible memory can share common data, address, and command lines with conventional DRAMs, a single memory card can be produced containing both conventional DRAMs and the nonvolatile, DRAM-compatible memories.",

The frequency at which the most power exists is divided by the number or twice the number, depending upon the construction of the motor, of commutation segments in the motor to determine the motor&#39;s frequency of rotation or velocity at measured power input. The parameters which are derived from the current time response points are taken from data in which such data has a significant, if not dominant influence.",

Each increment is allowed to cool for at least about 30 seconds between pours to form a sufficiently solid side-wall to prevent hot-tears.

The display controller allows for the definition of multiple bit planes when the display device supports color or multiple gray shades. Simultaneous storage of images to all defined planes is accomplished through the use of multi-store logic. Multi-store logic transforms a data stream defining foreground and background portions of an image within a given display area into a form that can be simultaneously written to the bit planes as required to create the necessary output. Under processor control, a video palette may be loaded to ensure that display output signals are routed to the correct connector pins. The routing of particular signals to particular pins is reconfigured through the selection and loading of the applicable video palette. Video connector leads are connected to the palette generated data signals or to electrical ground by means of reconfigurable jumpers.

The process provides a textured cooking surface free of sharp edges which increases the useful life of a non,stick coating applied thereto. The embossed cooking surface of the resulting frying device comprises a series of wave-like grooves embossed in the surface of the pan. The wave-like pattern of each groove is one-half G cycle out of phase with its neighboring adjacent grooves to form an alternating pattern of outwardly extending lands and inwardly extending roots. A raised portion or elevated surface is provided on the cooking surface disposed between the outwardly extending lands. The elevated surface is the primary cooking surface and is further the location of the inevitable initial wearing of the non-stick material. The remaining non-stick material, disposed in the grooves and between the roots is not subject to abrasive action and wears at a substantially slower rate. The raised portions or elevated cooking surfaces disposed between the lands comprise less than 30 percent of the upper cooking surface and therefore less than 30 percent of the nonstick coating disposed on the upper cooking surface is exposed to the abrasive action of cooking utensils or cleaning utensils.",

The method of the invention involves several steps, including: providing a first and second sequence of digitized images, which are typically stored in the computer system; providing the duration of total time of the transition between the first and second sequence of images; providing a resource means for specifying the transition between the first and second sequence; determining a first portion of the first sequence of images (the first portion having a duration in time less than or equal to the duration of the transition); determining a second portion of the second sequence (the second portion of the second sequence of images having a duration in time less than or equal to the duration of the transition); creating a transition template from the transition resource, the transition template having a duration equal to the transition; and combining the first portion of the first sequence and the second portion of the second sequence with the transition template to thereby produce a third sequence of images. The step of creating a transition template from the transition resource is further comprised of the steps of selecting objects, interpolating objects and/or a source image area and mapping objects to a source image area. In the combining step, the transition template is used to determine which portions of the first source sequence, the second source sequence, or both will be displayed in the third sequence of images. Also provided is a means for modifying a duration of the entire transition or for modifying a duration of individual frames within the transition.",

The frequency information includes at least one desired frequency and its amplitude and decay rate. Then, the frequency information is converted to a value for the physical parameter. The measurement signals are discrete time ultrasonic signals. Extraction is performed by transforming the ultrasonic signals to a Z-domain and converting at least one zero or pole in the Z-domain to the at least one frequency and its decay rate. The physical signals may be coherent light signals which are modulated based on the frequency information which is related to propagation of longitudinal ultrasonic waves in the object. When the object is a static film such as a cured layer formed on a substrate, the physical parameter may be thickness of the layer. When the object is a dynamic curable film such as a wet or dehydrated layer, its thickness changes over time from an initial value to an intermediate value and then to a final value. The initial value is obtained by processing the frequency information with a model of the propagation of the waves in the film. The intermediate value is predicted from the initial value and the final value is predicted from the intermediate value.",

The purely passive system detects the electric energy produced by the living source as it interacts with the crystalline lattice of conductive metal electrodes to produce a train of oscillating pulses, the amplitude of whose envelope decays as a linear function of log-time. Specific aspects of these pulses can be used to study the state of the living, or non-living, source and to detect changes in this state over time. The results of such studies of living sources can be interpreted, respectively, in terms of the state of health, or disease, of the source and of changes in the state of health, or disease, of the source, and can thus be used to recognize, characterize and evaluate conditions of the living organism and to quantify the effects of therapies and putative therapies.",

The present switched mode converter of electrical power has a secondary winding in a secondary circuit, which at a first phase both accumulates and releases energy to load, or only accumulates energy. At a second phase the secondary winding is connected to input voltage and/or releases the accumulated energy in the secondary circuit in order to increase power release of the primary winding to the load. The solution increases both the output energy and efficiency of the converter.",

The other end wall is formed by a piston capable of being shifted for tuning, the piston being attached at the end of a hollow piston rod (6) mounted in a bearing block (4), which also contains the resonator (16), in such a manner that it is concentric relative to the axis of the resonator and longitudinally shiftable. The waveguide (13) is attached to the bearing block (4) on that side of the resonator (16) which is opposite the piston (7) and extends along the outside of the bearing block parallel to the piston rod (6) after having been deflected 180°. Drive shafts (24, 34) for means for shifting the piston (7) and means for altering the coupling of the waveguide (13) are arranged on that side of the piston rod (6) opposite the waveguide (13) in the plane containing the axes of the waveguide and the piston rod (6) and are mounted in or on the bearing block (4). The bearing block (4) is attached to a head member (1) by means of rods (3) extending parallel to the waveguide (13) and to the drive shafts (24, 34), with the free end of the waveguide (13) being attached thereto and the free ends of the drive shafts (24, 34) being mounted therein, and having a hole (48) which is concentric relative to the piston rod (6).",

    "abstract_en": "A method for generating an image representation includes generating a set of embedded descriptors, comprising, for each of a set of patches of an image, extracting a patch descriptor which is representative of the pixels in the patch and embedding the patch descriptor in a multidimensional space to form an embedded descriptor. An image representation is generated by aggregating the set of embedded descriptors. In the aggregation, each descriptor is weighted with a respective weight in a set of weights, the set of weights being computed based on the patch descriptors for the image. Information based on the image representation is output. At least one of the extracting of the patch descriptors, embedding the patch descriptors, and generating the image representation is performed with a computer processor.",
