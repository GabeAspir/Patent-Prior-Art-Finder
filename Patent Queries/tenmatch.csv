     The invention relates to processes and catalysts that convert C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbons to useful partially oxygenated compounds, such as methane to methanol, under mild conditions. More particularly, it relates to use of molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of water, to convert such hydrocarbons to their corresponding partially oxygenated products. 
     Activation and oxygenation of lower alkanes (C 1 -C 8 ) into useful oxygenates has long been an attractive and challenging research area. One reason for this interest is the fact that lower alkanes, especially methane (CH 4 ) and ethane (C 2 H 6 ), are predominant constituents of natural gas, which is currently both abundant and inexpensive. However, activation of lower alkanes often requires severe conditions using heterogeneous catalysts, for example, a temperature greater than 500 degrees Celsius (° C.) combined with increased pressure. Under these reaction conditions the valuable oxygenate products are, unfortunately, not stable, and the formation of carbon oxides, such as carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), is usually observed. 
     In view of this problem, it is generally considered to be desirable to work at milder conditions, such that the formation of CO and/or CO 2  is reduced or eliminated and the stability of the oxygenate products formed is enhanced. To enable these milder conditions, some researchers have explored activation of CH 4  in the liquid phase, instead of in the gas phase. For example, B. Michalkiewicz, et al.,  J. Catal.,  215 (2003) 14, reports the oxygenation of CH 4  to organic oxygenates at 160° C. and a CH 4  pressure of 3.5 megapascals (MPa), using metallic palladium dissolved in oleum. That reference claims that methanol is obtained by the transformation of the CH 4  to methyl bisulfate and dimethyl sulphate, and the ester is subsequently hydrolyzed. Unfortunately, use of strong acidic media such as sulfuric acid involves corrosive, toxic reaction conditions and a large amount of waste. Other research using oleum is reported in L. Chen, et al.,  Energy and Fuels,  20 (2006) 915, wherein vanadium oxide (V 2 O 5 ) in oleum is employed, at 180° C. and a CH 4  pressure of 4.0 MPa. 
     Mild conditions are also used in E. D. Park, et al.,  Catal. Commun.  2 (2001) 187, and  Appl. Catal. A,  247 (2003) 269, wherein selective oxygenation of CH 4  is carried out using hydrogen peroxide generated in situ, using a palladium/carbon (Pd/C) and copper acetate (Cu(CH 3 COO) 2 ) catalyst system, with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoroacetic anhydride (TFAA) as solvents. The Pd/C serves as an in situ generator of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), while the Cu(CH 3 COO) 2  serves as the oxygenation catalyst. The reaction conditions disclosed include 80° C., 5 milliliters (mL) solvent, and a total gas pressure of 47.64 standard atmospheres (atm) (4.83 MPa) (71.4 percent (%) CH 4 , 14.3% hydrogen (H 2 ), 14.3% oxygen (O 2 )). This process, too, requires formation of an ester followed by subsequent hydrolysis, and thus is not direct. 
     A method involving direct conversion of CH 4  to oxygenate products is disclosed in Qiang Yuan, et al.,  Adv. Synth. Catal.  349 (2007) 1199, wherein CH 4  is oxidized in an aqueous medium using H 2 O 2  and homogeneous transition metal chlorides as catalysts. The transition metal chlorides may include, for example, iron chloride (FeCl 3 ), cobalt chloride (CoCl 2 ), ruthenium chloride (RuCl 3 ), rhodium chloride (RhCl 3 ), palladium chloride (PdCl 2 ), osmium chloride (OsCl 3 ), iridium chloride (IrCl 3 ), platinum hydrochloride (H 2 PtCl 6 ), copper chloride (CuCl 2 ), and gold hydrochloride (HAuCl 4 ). Unfortunately, in this process recovery and reuse of the homogeneous catalyst is difficult at best. 
     Other researchers have also addressed the use of microstructured catalysts. For example, Raja, et al.,  Appl. Catal. A: General,  158 (1997) L7, disclose a process to oxidize CH 4  to methanol using phthalocyanine complexes of iron (Fe) and copper (Cu) encapsulated in zeolites as catalysts, and a combination of oxygen (O 2 ) gas and tert-butyl hydroperoxide, which is in aqueous solution, as oxidants. The process includes an autoclave reactor and a suitable solvent, such as acetonitrile, and is carried out with the tert-butyl hydroperoxide at 273 degrees Kelvin (K) (0° C.) and a reaction time of 12 hours (h). The products include methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid and CO 2 . 
     Shul&#39;pin, et al.,  Tetrahedron Letters,  47 (2006) 3071, disclose a process for the oxygenation of alkanes (including CH 4 , C 2 H 6 , propane, n-butane, hexane, heptane, octane and nonane) using H 2 O 2  as the oxidant to form the corresponding alcohols and ketones. The process includes an autoclave reactor with, in the case of CH 4 , a pressure of 50 bar (5 MPa) and a reaction time of 24 h. The catalyst is a titanium-containing zeolite, “TS-1” (silicon (Si) to titanium (Ti) ratio is 20, Si/Ti=20), and while methanol is the main product, it is produced in such low amount (1.1 micromole (μmol) of methanol produced after 24 h), that potential as an industrial catalyst is not inferred. 
     Finally, Sorokin, et al.,  Chem. Commun.,  (2008) 2562, disclose the oxygenation of CH 4  under mild conditions (25-60° C., 32 bar (3.2 MPa) CH 4  pressure, 678 μmol H 2 O 2 , and a reaction time of 20 h) using a μ-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine complex in water as a homogeneous catalyst and, additionally, a silica-supported μ-nitrido diiron phthalocyanine complex. The products include methanol, formaldehyde and formic acid, with formic acid being the major product. 
     Hutchings et al.,  Nature,  437 (2005) 1132-1135 discloses the oxygenation of alkenes using air and initiator (tert-butyl hydroperoxide, TBHP) with high selectivity to partial oxygenation products and significant conversions using gold supported nanoparticles under solvent free conditions. The solvent effect is shown to be important in terms of activity and selectivity, i.e., where water is used as the solvent, no formation of the desired oxygenated products is detected. The reaction is carried out at 80° C. to enable the effective decomposition of the TBHP molecule. 
     While researchers have identified a number of operable processes, there is still a need to identify additional processes that are both environmentally benign and economically attractive, and that desirably do not require intermediate steps or products in order to produce the desired final oxygenate products, particularly partially oxygenated products, from C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbons. Specifically, the ability to use molecular oxygen as the oxidizing agent will increase the economic attractiveness of an oxygenation process over those that rely upon peroxides or other oxidizing materials for all of their oxygenation. This is even more so, when the over-oxygenation to carbon dioxide can be avoided. 
     In one embodiment the invention provides a process for the complete or partial oxygenation of hydrocarbons, comprising contacting a C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon, molecular oxygen, and hydrogen peroxide, in the presence of water and a heterogeneous catalyst, under conditions suitable to convert the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon to at least one corresponding C 1 -C 8  oxygenate product, wherein the heterogeneous catalyst provides confinement and contains both Brønsted-Lowry acid centers and Lewis acid centers. The reaction may be carried out at a temperature ranging from 2° C. to 200° C., preferably from 2° C. to 90° C. 
     The invention offers the advantages of very mild conditions with use of molecular (gaseous) oxygen, thereby improving the economics of oxygenation of lower hydrocarbons, including C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbons such as, for example, methane (CH 4 ). The process involves contacting a C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon, molecular oxygen (O 2 ), and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ), in the presence of a specific heterogeneous catalyst as further described hereinbelow, and water, wherein the water and the H 2 O 2  may be in gas phase, condensed phase, or a combination thereof. Conditions for the complete or partial oxygenation are those suitable to convert the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon to at least one of its corresponding C 1 -C 8  oxygenate or, preferably, partially oxygenated, products. By “corresponding” is meant an oxygenate product having the same number of carbon atoms as the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon being oxygenated. 
     The C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon may be saturated or unsaturated, cyclic or linear, or any combination thereof. In one embodiment the hydrocarbon is CH 4 ; in another embodiment it is C 2 H 6 ; in still another embodiment it is cyclohexane (C 6 H 12 ); and in yet another embodiment it is octane (C 8 H 18 ). Mixtures of hydrocarbons may also be selected. The hydrocarbon is desirably selected according to the target final oxygenate product(s), which may be, e.g., an alcohol, an alkyl peroxide, an aldehyde, a carboxylic acid, or a combination thereof. For example, if the desired final oxygenate product is methanol, methyl hydroperoxide, formaldehyde and/or formic acid, the selected hydrocarbon would desirably be CH 4 . 
     In practicing the invention the selected hydrocarbon is brought into contact with three additional required components. The first is at least one heterogeneous catalyst. Such is, by definition, heterogeneous, meaning that it is not soluble in the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon being converted, whether such hydrocarbon is in liquid phase, gas phase, or a combination thereof. The catalyst is further defined as containing both Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis acid centers. The nature of acid centers, and therefore identification of such centers as being of either the Brønsted-Lowry type or the Lewis-type, may be defined using any of several conventional methodologies. Among these are, for example, Temperature Programmed Desorption of Ammonia (TPD-NH 3 ); Infrared (IR) spectroscopy, based on either pyridine or NH 3 ; and Proton Magic Angle Spinning Nuclear Magnetic Resonance ( 1 H-MAS NMR), which is described in, for example, G. Busca,  Chem. Rev.,  107 (2007) 5366. 
     Using such methodologies, a “Brønsted-Lowry acid center” is identified as a hydrogen ion, i.e., a proton, that is donated by the catalyst to a reaction intermediate in the inventive process&#39;s primary oxygenation reaction, i.e., the oxygenation of the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon to form an oxygenate product. Determination of whether a given solid catalyst candidate donates a proton in a reaction may be carried out by, for example, IR spectroscopy, wherein a pyridine is made available for adsorption by the catalyst candidate. The presence of a Brønsted-Lowry acid center is confirmed if vibrations corresponding substantially to 1640, 1628, 1544, and 1492 cm −1  are recorded. These measurements represent a protonated pyridine complex, which means that a pyridinium ion has been formed, indicating the presence of a Brønsted-Lowry acid center in the catalyst. 
     A “Lewis acid center” is identified as a coordinatively-unsaturated metal cation. As used herein, the phrase “coordinatively-unsaturated metal cation” means that the catalyst contains a metal cation that is capable of forming a coordination complex with an available ligand. In the primary oxygenation reaction of the inventive process, the coordinatively unsaturated metal cation, for example, an aluminum (Al + ) or iron (Fe + ) cation having a low-lying vacant orbital, can serve as an electron acceptor. Determination of whether a given solid catalyst candidate accepts one or more electrons in a reaction may be carried out by, for example again, IR spectroscopy, wherein a pyridine is made available for adsorption by the catalyst candidate. The presence of a Lewis acid center is confirmed if vibrations corresponding substantially to 1624, 1618, and 1597 cm −1  are recorded. These vibrations are attributed to three different coordinatively complexed pyridine species, which means that a coordinative metal cation is present in the catalyst. Such coordinative metal cation is, by definition, a Lewis acid center. 
     It is notable that, in the catalysts that are useful in the inventive process, both Lewis and Brønsted-Lowry acid centers are present. Such may be both located on the surface of the catalyst, or, in the case of, for example, some types of porous crystalline catalysts, the Lewis acid centers may be located primarily on the exterior surface, while the Brønsted-Lowry acid centers may be located primarily in the interior of the pores. Alternatively, Lewis acid centers may be added to a catalyst that, in its as-synthesized form, contains only Brønsted-Lowry acid centers in pores thereof, by simply adding thereto a modifying metal heterocation, such as Fe + . This step will incorporate Lewis acid centers into the pores. Another effective approach, particularly useful where the starting catalyst is an aluminosilicate microporous material, is to treat the catalyst with steam at a temperature sufficient to cause dealumination of the structure within the micropores. The result of this dealumination is formation of Lewis acid centers in the micropores. It is generally within the understanding of those skilled in the art that suitable catalysts may display different amounts and strengths of Brønsted-Lowry-type and/or Lewis-type acidity on the same surface, depending upon the composition and structure of the catalyst, as well as the method of any given catalyst&#39;s preparation and any post-synthesis treatment(s) it may receive. The strength and the ratio of Lewis acid centers to Brønsted-Lowry acid centers will often affect the conversion and distribution of the obtained oxygenate products. For example, increasing the strength of both Lewis acid and Brønsted-Lowry acid sites leads to a progressive increase in alkane conversion, i.e., yield, of oxygenate products in general, while the selectivity to specific products may be varied by altering the ratio of Lewis acid centers to Brønsted-Lowry acid centers. 
     As noted hereinabove, the selected catalyst is capable of providing confinement of the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon molecules being oxidized. The term “confinement” as used herein means that the catalyst has a structure including pores, and that the pore dimensions are capable of at least partially admitting and holding (i.e., “confining”) the selected C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon molecules, thereby altering the admitted molecules&#39; structure and reactivity in some way. Another way of stating this is that the critical diameter of the selected C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon molecule is smaller than the average cross-sectional diameter of the pores. These pores may be micropores, having a diameter less than 2 nanometers (nm); mesopores, having a diameter from 2 nm to 50 nm; and/or macropores, having a diameter greater than 50 nm; with the characterization of a catalyst as being microporous, mesoporous, or macroporous being based on its predominant average pore diameter. In certain particular embodiments the catalyst is a molecular sieve, i.e., a microporous solid material, and preferably a molecular sieve including silicon (Si) and oxygen (O), for example, in the form of an oxide of silicon, i.e., silicon dioxide (“silica,” SiO 2 ). Such molecular sieve may also include, in its structure and not as a modifying metal or modifying metal oxide, aluminum (Al), for example, in the form of an oxide of aluminum, e.g., aluminum oxide (“alumina,” Al 2 O 3 ). Where both silica and alumina are present, the result is an aluminosilicate molecular sieve, which is also called a zeolite. Such may be naturally-occurring or synthetic, having a structure defined by the International Zeolite Association. Of particular effect may be those having a structure defined as an “MFI” type, such as those designated with the “ZSM” prefix, and of these the zeolite designated as “ZSM-5” may in some embodiments be preferred. The selected material may have a wide range of ratios of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 , ranging from 20 to 10,000. Other materials characterized as zeolites or zeotypes (i.e., artificial structures synthesized to correspond to defined zeolite structures), including but not limited to those having a beta structure, a mordenite structure, a ferrierite structure, a faujasite structure, a rho structure, or a chabazite structure, and combinations of such materials, may also be useful in the inventive process, provided such contain both Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis acid centers as described hereinabove. Further non-limiting examples include a variety of other zeolites, such as Zeolite-Y, Zeolite Beta (Zeolite-β), and Ferrierite. 
     The catalyst structure may be crystalline, amorphous, or a combination thereof, and in certain particular embodiments may include a relatively small amount of a modifying metal and/or a modifying metal oxide. Such modifying metal and/or modifying metal oxide is, by definition, different from any metals included in the primary structure of the catalyst, and may be selected from aluminum (Al), gallium (Ga), iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), titanium (Ti), and phosphorus (P); oxides thereof; and combinations thereof; in an amount ranging from 10 parts per million (ppm), i.e., a trace amount, to 10% by weight (wt %), based on the total weight of the catalyst. In preferred embodiments the amount may range from 1 wt % to 5 wt %, on the same basis. Thus, in one embodiment the catalyst may have a microporous crystalline aluminosilicate structure, further including a modifying metal or metal oxide other than Al or Al 2 O 3 , while in another embodiment the catalyst may have a silicate structure, and include a modifying metal or metal oxide such as, in non-limiting examples, Al, Al 2 O 3 , Ga, Fe, CuO Cu 2 O, or combinations thereof. Preferred catalysts may include iron modified versions of the ZSM-5 zeolite, e.g., those including from 10 ppm to 10 wt % of iron, based on the weight of the ZSM-5 zeolite, which is a metal-promoted aluminosilicate catalyst. Also preferred are metal-promoted silicalite catalysts, the silicalites being the silica analogues of ZSM-11. 
     The catalyst may be either supported or unsupported, or may serve simultaneously as both catalyst and support, and may be formed by a variety of methods. For example, in unsupported form the catalyst may be used as a crystalline or amorphous powder. Where a supported catalyst is desired, the catalyst may be combined with a binder into an extrudate or pellets for added strength and durability; may be deposited on or in a support material; or may be formed as a membrane. Support materials may be selected from, for example, ceramic materials, defined as inorganic non-metallic solids prepared by heating followed by cooling, including but not limited to oxides, such as zirconia; non-oxides such as carbides, nitrides, borides and silicides; other solids such as metals and alloys, for example, materials based on carbon, nickel, cobalt, molybdenum, and stainless steels; and combinations thereof. In certain embodiments, where a gas stream such as CH 4  or C 2 H 6  is to be oxidized, it may be particularly convenient to use a solid, supported catalyst. 
     The catalyst may be synthesized and/or modified, via post-synthesis treatment, by a method selected from, for example, hydrothermal synthesis, impregnation, deposition-precipitation, sol immobilization, sublimation, chemical vapor infiltration, or a combination thereof. In one embodiment it may be desirable to calcine the catalyst after it has been prepared, in order to increase its activity; in another embodiment it may be useful to reduce the catalyst with hydrogen; and in a third embodiment it may be useful to treat the catalyst in water vapor, e.g., steam, which may increase its selectivity to a desired target alcohol product. When the catalyst has been prepared by chemical vapor infiltration, washing the catalyst with acetone or an acid following preparation may desirably improve its activity and/or selectivity. Those skilled in the art will be able to determine, with routine experimentation at most, which, if any, of these synthesis and modification treatments may be most useful to obtain a catalyst best geared toward a given target product or product mix. 
     Synthetic zeolites useful in the inventive process may be prepared by slow crystallization of, in one embodiment, a silica-alumina gel in the presence of an alkali and an organic template. The product properties depend upon reaction mixture composition, pH of the system, operating temperature, pre-reaction and reaction times, and template used. One such process is a sol-gel method. In that method, other elements, including, for example, modifying metals and/or modifying metal oxides, may be conveniently incorporated in the zeolite structure. A calcination pre-treatment (i.e., post-synthesis, but prior to use in the inventive process), at a temperature from 200° C. to 800° C., preferably from 400° C. to 700° C., to increase the activity and/or alter the selectivity of the final catalyst prior to using it, may be particularly useful for zeolites. Such pre-treatment may be performed in a static or flow procedure in a diluent selected from air, H 2 , an inert gas, and combinations thereof. Water vapor may optionally be included with the diluent. 
     The inventive process includes contacting the selected C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon, the molecular O 2 , and the H 2 O 2  in the presence of water. In order to do this, in one non-limiting embodiment the hydrocarbon may be fed, with or without a diluent, in gas phase or condensed phase (condensed phase being, accordingly, a solid, a combination of a solid and a liquid, e.g., a dispersion or slurry, or a combination of a gas and a liquid, e.g., an aerosol), to a reaction vessel containing the heterogeneous catalyst. There the heterogeneous catalyst, for example, an iron-modified ZSM-5 zeolite, activates the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon, molecular O 2 , water, and H 2 O 2  mixture to form one or more corresponding at least partially oxidized products (“oxygenate products”). Such products may include, for example, an alcohol that corresponds to, i.e., has the same number of carbon atoms as, the starting C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon. In certain embodiments the reaction may be carried out at a temperature ranging from 2° C. to 200° C., preferably from 2° C. to 90° C., more preferably from 20° C. to 80° C., and most preferably from 30° C. to 70° C. For example, some of the described heterogeneous zeolite catalysts may effectively catalyze the reaction of CH 4 , gaseous oxygen, and H 2 O 2  in water to form methanol (CH 3 OH), using a temperature as low as 2° C., with minimal losses to CO or CO 2  as by-products. In certain embodiments the amount of water may range from trace (10 ppm) levels to 50 wt % or higher, based on the combined weight of water, C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon, and H 2 O 2 , and a minimum of 50 wt % of water may be preferred, particularly in condensed phase reactions. Also in particular embodiments, the process may be effectively conducted to maintain a total system pressure ranging from 1 to 140 atm (0.101 MPa to 14.19 MPa), more preferably from 8 to 100 atm (0.81 MPa to 10.13 MPa), and most preferably from 20 to 70 atm (2.03 MPa to 7.09 MPa). Moreover, it may be desirable that the process be conducted such that, where the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon is not entirely in solution, any amount thereof that is in gas phase be maintained within a similar pressure range. In one particular embodiment, the process may be carried out entirely in gas phase, as either a continuous or cyclic process. 
     The amounts of molecular oxygen and hydrogen peroxide that are used to react with the selected C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon are preferably effective to at least partially oxidize the hydrocarbon to its corresponding target oxygenate product(s). Because molecular O 2  is generally much less expensive than neat H 2 O 2 , it is generally desirable to maximize the amount of O 2  and minimize the amount of H 2 O 2  such that the majority, if possible, of the incorporated oxygen in the C 1 -C 8  oxygenate comes from the molecular oxygen and not from the hydrogen peroxide. The source of the oxygen being incorporated may be determined using  18 O 2  in a gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS) analysis. At the same time it is desirable to avoid over-oxygenation of the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon to form undesired products, e.g., where over-oxygenation will result in alkyl peroxides, aldehydes, and/or carboxylic acids, in cases where alcohols are desired. Those skilled in the art will be aware that it is also advisable to ensure that the molar ratio of molecular O 2  to H 2 O 2 , and the C 1 -C 8  hydrocarbon and diluent pressures, are selected to avoid potentially explosive combinations. In general it is desirable that the molar ratio of molecular O 2  to H 2 O 2  range from 1:10, preferably from 1:5, more preferably from 1:1, and most preferably from 10:1. 
     Following formation of the desired target oxygenate product or mixture of products, appropriate separation steps may be carried out where necessary. Standard separation means and methods may be employed. Where the catalyst or combination of catalysts is/are solid and insoluble in either liquid or gas phase, such may be conveniently separated using simple filtration, and optionally then appropriately regenerated and/or recycled back into the same or a different reaction process. Regeneration steps may include, for example, burning off any build-up on the catalyst or treating the catalyst with a fresh hydrogen peroxide solution. The catalyst may also be subjected to such regeneration periodically, according to need. Thus, the process of the invention may be operated as a batch, semi-batch, or continuous process. 
    
    
     EXAMPLES 
     In the Examples the following are used without further purification from BOC Gases: CH 4 , 99.999% purity,  18 O 2  99% of  18 O atom purity,  16 O 2  99.99% purity. The gas mixture of the reactor is removed using a gas sampling bag and analysis is performed using GC. Liquid-phase products are analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H-NMR). Deuterium oxide (D 2 O) is used as the lock reference. In the  1 H-NMR analysis, a sealed capillary tube is prepared with a solution of tetramethylsilane (TMS) and chloroform (CHCl 3 ). H 2 O 2  yield is determined by titration of aliquots of the final filtered solution with acidified cesium sulphate (Ce(SO 4 ) 2 ) solutions, which have been standardized against hydrated ammonium ferrosulphate (NH 4 ) 2 Fe(SO 4 ) 2 ·6H 2 O using ferroin as the indicator. The commercially available catalyst, Zeolite ZSM-5, is obtained from Zeolyst International, and samples of the Zeolite ZSM-5 are calcined in static air at 600° C. prior to use in the Examples unless indicated otherwise. A parenthetical number immediately following the zeolite name, e.g., “(30),” indicates the molar ratio of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3  as provided by the supplier. Iron acetylacetonate (Fe(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 3 ) having a purity greater than 99.95% is supplied by Sigma Aldrich. 
     Preparation of a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) Catalyst by Chemical Vapor Infiltration (CVI). 
     Fe/ZSM-5 (30) catalyst is prepared by CVI as follows. A 1 gram (g) sample of commercially obtained ZSM-5 (30) zeolite is treated under vacuum for 2 h. A commercial sample of iron acetylacetonate (Fe(C 5 H 7 O 2 ) 3  (0.0774 g), corresponding to a nominal final metal loading of 1.1 wt %, is then mixed with the vacuum-treated ZSM-5 zeolite. The mixture is placed under vacuum and heated to 150° C. for 2 h. The material is then removed and calcined in air at 400° C. for 3 h. 
     Comparative Example A 
     Liquid Phase Oxygenation of CH 4  with H 2 O 2  Using a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) CVI Catalyst 
     Catalytic oxygenation of CH 4  is carried out using a stainless-steel autoclave (Parr reactor) containing a Teflon™-lined vessel with a total volume of 50 mL. A measured amount of Fe/ZSM-5 zeolite synthesized by CVI (0.028 g) is charged to the vessel, which has already been charged with a 10 mL solution of distilled water and an amount of H 2 O 2  (50 wt %, 0.005 mole (mol)). The total volume of the reaction solution is 10 mL. Air in the reactor is removed by purging 3 times with CH 4  at 200 pounds per square inch (psi) (13.61 bar, 1.37 MPa), and then the system is pressurized with CH 4  and/or O 2  to a fixed pressure (440 psi, 3.03 MPa, 0.03 mol). The autoclave is heated to 50° C. Once respective reaction temperature is attained, the solution is vigorously stirred at 1500 revolutions per minute (rpm) and maintained at the reaction temperature for 0.5 h to enable completion of each respective oxygenation reaction. At the end of the reaction the autoclave is cooled with ice to a temperature of 12° C. to minimize the CH 3 OH volatility and loss. Products of the reaction are subsequently analyzed and results are shown in Table 1. 
     Comparative Example B 
     Liquid Phase Oxygenation of CH 4  with H 2 O 2  Using a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) CVI Catalyst 
     According to the method of Comparative Example A, a liquid phase oxygenation of CH 4  is carried out using a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) CVI catalyst, with the exception that the catalyst loading is 0.054 g, reaction volume is 20 mL, the H 2 O 2  concentration is 1 M, and the total reactor pressure is 5.5 bar (0.55 MPa). Products of the reaction are subsequently analyzed and results are shown in Table 1. 
     Comparative Example C 
     Liquid Phase Oxygenation of CH 4  with Molecular O 2  Using a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) CVI Catalyst 
     According to the method of Comparative Example A, a liquid phase oxygenation of CH 4  is carried out using a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) CVI catalyst, with the exception that no H 2 O 2  is added to the reaction mixture and a gas phase composition 85.7:14.3 mole/mole ratios of CH 4  and  16 O 2  is used in total pressure of 35 bar (3.5 MPa). This corresponds to the same amount of ‘O’ from H 2 O 2  as in Comparative Example A. Products of the reaction are subsequently analyzed and results are shown in Table 1. No products are detected when molecular O 2  is used as the sole oxidant. 
     Example 1 
     Liquid Phase Oxygenation of CH 4  with H 2 O 2  and Molecular O 2  Using a Fe/ZSM-5 (30) CVI Catalyst 
     The liquid phase oxygenation of CH 4  with H 2 O 2  in the presence of molecular O 2  is carried out according to the method of Comparative Example A, while using a 96.5:3.5 mole/mole ratio of CH 4  and  18 O 2 . Products of the reaction are subsequently analyzed and results are shown in Table 1. 
     The reaction filtrate from Example 1 is analyzed by LC-MS as follows: The as-filtered aqueous reaction mixture is infused into an electro-spray source operating at capillary voltage of 3.5 kilovolts (kV) and cone voltage of 100 volts (V). The spectrometer is operated in EI-mode (electro-spray ionization negative mode), such that the major reaction product, formic acid (HCOOH) as determined separately by  1 H-NMR, can be observed in its de-protonated dimeric/trimeric form. Dimers of HCOOH are observed with incorporation of one  18 O per dimer, i.e., one labeled oxygen atom out of 4 oxygen atoms per dimer. In total 6% incorporation of  18 O 2  is observed by integration of the peaks obtained from this analysis. The product analysis shows an increase in oxygenate productivity when  18 O 2  is present in the reaction.

     BACKGROUND ART 
     A semiconductor device in which a semiconductor element and a heat sink are joined with solder has been developed There is a difference in a thermal expansion coefficient between the semiconductor element and the heat sink. Accordingly, as a temperature of the semiconductor device changes, there arises a difference in an amount of dimension change between the semiconductor element and the heat sink. The difference in the amount of dimension change is large on a diagonal line of the semiconductor element. Accordingly, thermal stress is likely to occur at four corner parts of the semiconductor element. In a semiconductor device disclosed in Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-170702, a thickness of solder that joins corner parts of a semiconductor element and a heat sink (a substrate body) is made thicker than a thickness of portions other than the corner parts of the semiconductor element. Thereby, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element when the temperature of the semiconductor element changes is reduced. 
     SUMMARY OF INVENTION 
     Technical Problem 
     In the technology of Japanese Patent Application Publication No. 2009-170702, the thickness of solder is made thicker in the corner parts of the semiconductor element. Accordingly, size of the semiconductor device is increased. 
     The present description provides a technology capable of reducing thermal stress occurring in a semiconductor element while suppressing the increase of size of a semiconductor device. 
     Solution to Technical Problem 
     A semiconductor device disclosed in the present description comprises a semiconductor element having a rectangular shape in a plan view and a fixed member to which the semiconductor element is fixed. The semiconductor element is disposed so that a rectangular face of the semiconductor element is faced toward a surface of the fixed member. A part of the rectangular face of the semiconductor element is fixed to the surface of the fixed member. At least corner parts of the rectangular face of the semiconductor element are not fixed to the surface of the fixed member. 
     In the semiconductor device mentioned above, the corner parts of the semiconductor element, in which thermal stress is likely to occur when the temperature of the semiconductor device changes, and the fixed member are not fixed to each other. Thereby, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element can be reduced. Moreover, since only a configuration where the corner parts of the semiconductor element and the fixed member are not fixed to each other is adopted, it is possible to suppress the increase of the size of the semiconductor device.

     DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 
     Some of specific features of embodiments and variations will be listed below. It should be noted that technical features described below are independent from each other, and may technically be useful alone. 
     In a semiconductor device disclosed in the present description, a rectangular face of a semiconductor element may be fixed to a surface of a fixed member with a joint material. A dent may be formed on the surface of the fixed member at a position corresponding to each of corner parts of the rectangular face of the semiconductor element. 
     In the semiconductor device mentioned above, when the semiconductor element is fixed to the fixed member, the joint material flows into portions in which the dents have been formed. Accordingly, the corner parts of the semiconductor element and the fixed member are prevented from being fixed to each other. Thereby, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element can be reduced. 
     In the semiconductor device disclosed in the present description, the semiconductor device may further comprise an intermediate member which is disposed between the rectangular face of the semiconductor element and the surface of the fixed member. The semiconductor element and the fixed member may be fixed to each other via the intermediate member. The intermediate member may not be positioned between at least the corner parts of the rectangular face of the semiconductor element and the surface of the fixed member. 
     In the semiconductor device mentioned above, the intermediate member is not positioned between the corner parts of the semiconductor element and the fixed member. Accordingly, the corner parts of the semiconductor element and the fixed member are prevented from being fixed to each other. Thereby, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element can be reduced. 
     First Embodiment 
     As shown in  FIGS. 1 to 4 , a semiconductor device  2  comprises a semiconductor element  4  and a heat sink  6  to which the semiconductor element  4  is fixed. The semiconductor element  4  is a so-called semiconductor chip. The semiconductor element  4  has a rectangular shape (specifically, a square shape) in a plan view. The semiconductor element  4  may alternatively be an oblong rectangle. Moreover, the semiconductor element  4  is an IGBT. The semiconductor element  4  may alternatively be other types of semiconductor elements, such as a MOSFET, for example. 
     The semiconductor element  4  comprises a SiC substrate. The SiC substrate has an active region  4   a  in a center part in the plan view, and has a peripheral region  4   b  around the active region  4   a , specifically in an outer peripheral part of the semiconductor element  4  (see  FIG. 3 ). In the active region  4   a , respective regions of a gate, an emitter region, a body contact region, a body region, a drift region and a collector region are formed. However, since these configurations in the semiconductor element  4  are conventionally publicly known, their explanations will be omitted. On a front surface of the semiconductor element  4 , an emitter electrode (not shown), a gate pad (not shown), and the body contact region are formed. On a back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4 , a collector electrode is formed. The collector electrode is formed on the entire area of the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4 . The semiconductor element  4  is disposed such that the back surface  42  thereof is faced toward a surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  that will be mentioned later. 
     The heat sink  6  is formed of metal. As a material for forming the heat sink  6 , Cu (copper) can be used, for example. The heat sink  6  has a rectangular shape in the plan view (see  FIG. 1 ). The heat sink  6  has a larger area than the semiconductor element  4 . On the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 , dent parts  10  are formed. Each of the dent parts  10  is formed at a position corresponding to one of the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  when the semiconductor element  4  is disposed on the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  (that is, the dent parts  10  are formed in four places). 
     Each of the dent parts  10  has a shape of an isosceles right triangle in the plan view (each of the dent parts  10  may alternatively have other shapes, as will be mentioned later). An apex, at which two sides cross at a right angle in each of the dent parts  10 , is positioned outside the semiconductor element  4 . Each of apexes of the four corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  is positioned at a center of the corresponding dent part  10 . The back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  has faces  44 , which are portions that overlap with the corresponding dent parts  10 , and a face  46 , which is a portion that does not overlap with the dent parts  10 , in the plan view (see  FIG. 4 ). Fixation with solder  8  is not performed between the faces  44  and the heat sink  6  (the corresponding dent part  10  of the heat sink  6 , in detail). Fixation with the solder  8  is performed between the face  46  and the heat sink  6  (a portion where the dent parts  10  are not formed in the heat sink  6 , in detail). 
     As shown in  FIGS. 3 and 4 , inner surfaces of each of the dent parts  10  have a face  12 , a face  14   a , and a face  14   b  (the face  14   a  and the face  14   b  are combined to be represented as a face  14  in  FIG. 4 ). The face  12  is positioned on a center side of the semiconductor element  4 . The faces  14   a ,  14   b  are positioned on a side opposite of the center side of the semiconductor element  4 . The face  12  inclines relative to the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 . An angle made between the face  12  and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  is called an angle θ in the explanation below. The angle θ can be made smaller than, for example, 45 degrees. The angle θ will be mentioned later. Excessive metals  16  are formed on the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 . Each of the excessive metals  16  is formed on the opposite side of a center of the semiconductor element  4  relative to the corresponding dent part  10 . As mentioned above, the back surface  42  (specifically, the face  46  which is a part of the back surface  42 ) of the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  6  are fixed to each other with the solder  8 . Thereby, the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  6  are electrically connected. As a result, the heat sink  6  can be used as an electrode (an electrode on a collector side, in detail) of semiconductor device  2 . Moreover, while the semiconductor device  2  is in use, heat generated in the semiconductor element  4  can be radiated outside via the heat sink  6 . Thereby, the temperature rise of the semiconductor element  4  can be suppressed. 
     Explanations will be made below on a method for manufacturing the semiconductor device  2  of the present embodiment. The heat sink  6  is manufactured by forming the dent parts  10  on the front surface  6   a  of a plate made of copper. As a method for forming the dent parts  10 , press working can be used as an example. Press working is performed so that the excessive metals  16  of the heat sink  6  may be formed on the opposite side of the center of the semiconductor element  4  relative to the corresponding dent part  10 . 
     After the dent parts  10  are formed on the heat sink  6 , a sheet-like solder (hereafter this is called a solder sheet) is disposed on the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 . The solder sheet (not shown) can be made, for example, so as to have the same shape (that is, a rectangular shape) and the same size as the semiconductor element  4  when it is viewed in the plan view. The solder sheet is disposed so that each of the corner parts of the solder sheet is positioned above the corresponding dent part  10 . After the solder sheet is disposed on the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 , the semiconductor element  4  is disposed on the solder sheet. As mentioned above, the semiconductor element  4  is disposed so that each of the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  is positioned above the corresponding dent part  10 . That is, by disposing the semiconductor element  4 , the semiconductor element  4  is superposed on the solder sheet. 
     The excessive metals  16  of the heat sink  6  produced by press working are formed on the opposite side of the center of the semiconductor element  4  relative to the corresponding dent part  10 , as mentioned above. That is, each of the excessive metals  16  is formed at a position which does not overlap with the semiconductor element  4  in the plan view. Accordingly, when the semiconductor element  4  is disposed, interference occurring between the semiconductor element  4  and the excessive metals  16  is suppressed. 
     Next, a temperature of the semiconductor device  2  is raised to a temperature that is a melting point of the solder  8  or higher. As the temperature is raised, the solder sheet melts into a liquid state. At positions other than the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  (that is, positions where the dent parts  10  are not formed), a liquid-state solder  8  is filled between the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  At this time, the solder  8 , which is positioned at the corner parts of the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  (that is, positions which overlap the dent parts  10 ), flows into the corresponding dent part  10  and accumulates at a bottom of the corresponding dent part  10 . A volume of the dent part  10  is designed in advance so as to become larger than a volume of the solder  8  positioned above the corresponding dent part  10 . Accordingly, the liquid-state solder  8  is not filled between the corner parts of the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 . On the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 , surface treatment that improves wettability of the solder  8  may be performed in advance. As the surface treatment, for example, Ni-plating and Au-plating can be used Moreover, this surface treatment may be performed on the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4 . Moreover, the semiconductor device  2  may adopt a configuration where this surface treatment is not performed on positions that correspond to the faces  44  mentioned above and the dent parts  10 . Thereby, it is prevented that the solder  8  exists at the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 . As a result, it is prevented that the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  6  are fixed. 
     Next, the temperature of the semiconductor device  2  is lowered to a temperature that is the melting point of the solder  8  or lower. As the temperature lowers, the liquid-state solder  8  solidifies. Thereby, the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  (the face  46  that is a part of the back surface  42 , in detail) and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  are fixed with the solder  8  that has become solidified. On the other hand, at the dent parts  10  in which the liquid-state solder  8  is not filled, the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  (the faces  44  that are parts of the back surface  42 , in detail) and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  are not fixed even if the temperature is lowered. 
     In the semiconductor device  2  of the present embodiment, the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 , at which thermal stress is likely to occur, and the heat sink  6  are not fixed to each other. Thereby, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element  4  when the temperature of the semiconductor device  2  changes can be reduced. Moreover, since only a configuration where the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  6  are not fixed to each other is adopted, it is possible to suppress the increase of the size of the semiconductor device  2 . 
     Moreover, as mentioned above, the semiconductor element  4  has the active region  4   a  in the center part of the semiconductor element  4  (the semiconductor substrate, in detail) in the plan view, and has the peripheral region  4   b  in the outer peripheral part of the semiconductor element  4 . Unlike the active region, the peripheral region  4   b  does not generate heat with the use of the semiconductor element  4 . Accordingly, a temperature of the center part of the semiconductor element  4  can be higher than a temperature of the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 . Moreover, in the peripheral part of the semiconductor element  4 , heat is likely to be radiated to the environment On the other hand, in the center part of the semiconductor element  4 , heat is unlikely to be radiated to the environment Also for this reason, in the semiconductor element  4  having a rectangular shape, the temperature of the center part of the semiconductor element  4  can be higher than the temperature of the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 . 
     When the temperature of the center part of the semiconductor element  4  becomes higher than the temperature of the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 , the quantity of heat transferred from the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  to the heat sink  6  is smaller compared to the quantity of heat transferred from the center part of the semiconductor element  4  to the heat sink  6 . In the semiconductor device  2  of the present embodiment, positions at which the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  are not fixed are the positions of the corner parts where the quantity of heat to be transferred is small Accordingly, while fixation is being performed partially between the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  and the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 , reduction of the quantity of heat that is transferred from the semiconductor element  4  to the heat sink  6  is suppressed. 
     Each of the dent parts  10  may be formed at a position so as to overlap with the peripheral region  4   b  of the semiconductor device  2  in the plan view. Thereby, the dent parts  10  do not inhibit the heat transfer from the semiconductor element  4  to the heat sink  6 . Thereby, deterioration of heat radiation performance of the semiconductor device  2  is suppressed. 
     In the semiconductor device  2  in which the semiconductor element  4  is fixed to the heat sink  6 , heat generated from the semiconductor element  4  is transferred to the heat sink  6  via the solder  8 . In  FIG. 2 , heat generated from the semiconductor element  4  is transferred from a region in which the solder  8  is positioned toward inside (a lower side in  FIG. 2 ) of the heat sink  6 . When heat is transferred toward the inside of the heat sink  6 , it is transferred from the region in which the solder  8  is positioned, not only toward a straightly lower direction, but also toward wider directions compared to the region in which the solder  8  is positioned. That is, a heat transfer path, through which the heat is transferred from the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  to the inside of the heat sink  6 , is formed so as to gradually widen from the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6  toward a deeper position of the heat sink  6 . In the semiconductor device  2  of the present embodiment, the angle θ made between the inner surface of the corresponding dent part  10  and the rectangular face of the semiconductor element  4  is made smaller than 45 degrees. Accordingly, it is suppressed that forming the dent parts  10  on the heat sink  6  cause a width of the heat transfer path mentioned above to narrow. Thereby, deterioration of the heat radiation performance of the semiconductor device  2  due to the dent parts  10  is suppressed. 
     In the semiconductor device  2  of the present embodiment, the dent parts  10  are formed on the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 . Accordingly, in the manufacturing process of the semiconductor device  2 , when disposing the solder sheet, the semiconductor element  4 , a jig (for example, a jig for performing reflow of the solder  8 ), etc. on the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 , each of the dent parts  10  can be used as a mark for alignment 
     In the semiconductor device  2  of the present embodiment, the dent parts  10  are formed by press working. Accordingly, unlike a case where the dent parts  10  are formed by cutting work or the like, the volume of the heat sink  6  does not decrease due to the processing of the dent parts  10 . Accordingly, a heat capacity of the heat sink  6  does not decrease. Thereby, deterioration of the heat radiation performance of the semiconductor device  2  is suppressed. 
     In the above embodiment, a solder sheet was disposed between the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  6 , and then by raising temperature, a liquid-state solder  8  was filled between the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  6 . However, the liquid-state solder  8  may be filled by applying a liquid-state solder  8  to either the back surface of the semiconductor element  4  or the front surface  6   a  of the heat sink  6 . 
     In the above embodiment, a shape of each of the dent parts  10  is a triangle in the plan view. However, the shape of each of the dent parts  10  may alternatively be other shapes. For example, each of the dent parts  10  may have a semicircular shape, a circular shape, an elliptic shape, a rectangular shape, a polygonal shape, etc. Moreover, in the above embodiment, each of the dent parts  10  was formed by press working. However, each of the dent parts  10  may be formed by other methods such as cutting work. 
     Second Embodiment 
     As shown in  FIGS. 5 and 6 , a semiconductor device  102  of the second embodiment comprises the semiconductor element  4 , a heat sink  106 , and an intermediate member  104 . The heat sink  106  is formed of Cu (copper) similarly to the heat sink  6  of the first embodiment. The intermediate member  104  is disposed on the front surface  106   a  of the heat sink  106 . The intermediate member  104  is plate-shaped, and has a rectangular shape in a plan view. However, the intermediate member  104  has a shape with the corner parts thereof chamfered in the plan view. The intermediate member  104  is formed of metal. As an example of a material for forming the intermediate member  104 , CuMo (molybdenum copper) can be used. Explanations will be made later in detail on a material for forming the intermediate member  104 . The front surface  106   a  of the heat sink  106  and the back surface of the intermediate member  104  are fixed with the solder  8 . 
     The semiconductor element  4  is disposed on the front surface of the intermediate member  104 . The front surface of the intermediate member  104  and the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  are fixed with the solder  8 . However, since chamfering is performed on the intermediate member  104 , the intermediate member  104  does not exist at a position corresponding to each of the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 . Accordingly, the corner parts of the semiconductor  4  and the intermediate member  104  are not fixed to each other. 
     In the semiconductor device  102  of the present embodiment, the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4 , at which thermal stress is likely to occur, and the intermediate member  104  are not fixed to each other. Thereby, as the temperature of the semiconductor device  102  changes, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element  4  can be reduced. 
     When it is assumed that the coefficient of linear expansion of the semiconductor element  4  is α 1 , the coefficient of linear expansion of the intermediate member  104  is α 2  and that the coefficient of linear expansion of the heat sink  106  is a 3 , a material of the intermediate member  104  is selected so that a relationship of α 1 ≦α 2 &lt;α 3  may be satisfied. For example, when the semiconductor element  4  (specifically, a semiconductor substrate) is formed of SiC and the heat sink  106  is formed of Cu (copper), CuMo (molybdenum copper) can be used as a material for forming the intermediate member  104 . Moreover; when the coefficient of linear expansion of the semiconductor element  4  (α 1 ) is larger than the coefficient of linear expansion of the heat sink  106  (α 3 ), the material of the intermediate member  104  may be selected so that a relationship of an α 1 ≧α 2 &gt;α 3  may be satisfied. Note that the coefficient of linear expansion of the intermediate member  104  (α 2 ) may be equal to the coefficient of linear expansion of the semiconductor element  4  (α 1 ). 
     There is a difference in the coefficient of linear expansion between the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  106 . Accordingly, in a semiconductor device in which the semiconductor element  4  is directly fixed to the heat sink  106  with solder, when a temperature of the semiconductor device is raised, thermal stress occurs according to a difference in the amount of dimension change between the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  106 . In the semiconductor device  102  of the second embodiment, the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  106  are fixed via the intermediate member  104 . Moreover, the coefficient of linear expansion of the intermediate member  104  (α 2 ) satisfies the relationship of α 1 ≦α 2 &lt;α 3 . With the above relationship satisfied, a difference in the amount of dimension change between the semiconductor element  4  and the intermediate member  104  becomes smaller than a difference in the amount of dimension change between the semiconductor element  4  and the heat sink  106 . Accordingly, in the semiconductor device  102  of the present embodiment, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element  4  can be reduced compared to a case where the semiconductor element  4  is directly fixed to the heat sink  106 . 
     COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 
     Explanations will be made below on a result of numerical computation with respect to thermal stress analysis for a semiconductor device (not shown) of the comparative example (see  FIG. 7 ). This thermal stress analysis is performed by simulating a cooling/heating cycle test. The semiconductor device of the comparative example has a configuration substantially identical to that of the semiconductor device  2  of the first embodiment. Therefore, explanations will be made on the configuration of the semiconductor device of the comparative example by using  FIG. 1 . In the semiconductor device of the comparative example, the semiconductor element  4  is fixed to the front surface of the heat sink  6 , similarly to the semiconductor device  2  of the first embodiment (see  FIG. 1 ). However, in the comparative example, the dent parts  10  are not formed on the surface of the heat sink  6 , unlike the case of the first embodiment. Accordingly, in the semiconductor device of the comparative example, an entire area (including corner parts) of the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  is fixed to the front surface of the heat sink  6 . 
     The result of numerical computation represented in  FIG. 7  is related to nonlinear strain amplitude.  FIG. 7  shows distribution of a region  204  where the magnitude of nonlinear strain amplitude is relatively large and a region  202  where the magnitude of nonlinear strain amplitude is relatively small. Nonlinear strain amplitude is calculated using a formula of (plastic strain+creep strain)/2. At a position in which the magnitude of nonlinear strain amplitude is large, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element  4  is also large. The region  204  where nonlinear strain amplitude is relatively large is positioned at each of the corner parts of the back surface  200  of the semiconductor element  4 . That is,  FIG. 7  shows that thermal stress occurring at the corner parts of the semiconductor element  4  is larger than thermal stress occurring in other parts. In the respective corresponding semiconductor devices  2  and  102  of embodiments 1 and 2, the corner parts of the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4 , at which thermal stress is likely to become large, and the heat sink are not fixed to each other. Accordingly, in the respective corresponding semiconductor devices  2  and  102  of embodiments 1 and 2, thermal stress occurring in the semiconductor element  4  can be effectively reduced. 
     In the above embodiments, the semiconductor element  4  comprised a SiC substrate. However, the semiconductor element  4  may comprise a Si substrate. 
     In the above first embodiment, fixation with the solder  8  was performed between the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  and the portion of the heat sink  6  in which the dent parts  10  are not formed. However, there may exist a spot (for example, a void etc.) in which fixation is not partially performed between the two. Similarly, there may exist a spot in which fixation is not partially performed between the back surface  42  of the semiconductor element  4  of above second embodiment and the front surface of the intermediate member  104 .

     TECHNICAL FIELD 
     The present invention relates to a method of manufacturing polyalkylene carbonate including solution-polymerizing an epoxide compound and carbon dioxide. 
     BACKGROUND ART 
     Polyalkylene carbonate is a polymer material useful for being used as a packing material, a coating material, and the like. In order to prepare the polyalkylene carbonate, a method of preparing the polyalkylene carbonate from an epoxy compound and carbon dioxide is known, wherein the method has an environmentally friendly high value in that phosgene being a noxious compound is not used and carbon dioxide is capable of being obtained in the air. Accordingly, many researchers have developed various types of catalysts in order to prepare polyalkylene carbonate from the epoxy compound and the carbon dioxide. 
     Since 2000, the development has significantly advanced in fields for developing the catalysts. Among them, development of a binary catalyst system using a mixture of a (Salen)Co compound or a (Salen)Cr compound [H 2 Salen=N,N′-bis(3,5-dialkylsalicylidene)-1,2-cyclohexanediamine)], and an onium salt such as [R 4 N]Cl or PPNCl (bis(triphenylphophine)iminium chloride) or a base such as amine or phosphine is representative. With respect to the binary catalyst system of the (Salen)Co compound, a mechanism in which epoxide is coordinated to the metal center having a lewis acid group to be activated, and nucleophilic-attack is performed thereon by carbonate anions derived from an onium salt or a bulky amine base was suggested. 
     Meanwhile, Chinese Patent Application Publication No. 101412809 discloses a method of synthesizing a salen-typed Co complex catalyst including one or two dimensionally large neutral organic base group(s) (TBD) and a method of preparing polyalkylene carbonate by copolymerizing an epoxide compound and carbon dioxide by using the same. 
     However, in the above-mentioned methods, copolymerization only using a bulk polymerization is disclosed. In the bulk polymerization, a catalytic activity is excellent; however, after the polymerization is completed, it is difficult to perform post-treatment processes such as control of side reactions in self-polymerization of epoxide, cleaning of a reactor, and removal of metal residue in the polymer, such that scale up is not easily conducted.

     DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS 
     Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in more detail. The terms and words used in the present specification and claims should not be interpreted as being limited to typical meanings or dictionary definitions, but should be interpreted as having meanings and concepts relevant to the technical scope of the present invention based on the rule according to which an inventor can appropriately define the concept of the term to appropriately describe the best method he or she knows for carrying out the invention. 
     According to exemplary embodiments of the present invention, there is provided a method of manufacturing polyalkylene carbonate including solution-polymerizing an epoxide compound and continuously or non-continuously injected carbon dioxide in the presence of a catalyst represented by the following Chemical Formula 1 and a solvent, wherein the solvent is selected from the group consisting of ethylene dichloride, benzene and hexane: 
     
       
         
         
             
             
         
       
     
     in Chemical Formula 1, 
     Q is C1-C20 alkylene, C3-C20 cycloalkylene, C6-C30 arylene, or C1-C20 dioxy radical, including or not including halogen, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, or phosphorus atom, 
     R 1  to R 7  are each independently or simultaneously, hydrogen; or a C1-C20 alkyl group, a C2-C20 alkenyl group, a C7-C20 alkylaryl group, or a C7-C20 arylalkyl group, including or not including at least one of halogen, nitrogen, oxygen, silicon, sulfur, and phosphorus atom, 
     R 8  to R 13  are each independently hydrogen or a C1-C20 alkyl group, 
     n is an integer of 1 to 10, and 
     X is —Cl, —NO 3  or —OAc. 
     In the method of manufacturing the polyalkylene carbonate using the epoxide compound and the carbon dioxide, a method of solution-polymerizing using a specific solvent and a catalyst is provided. 
     That is, in the related art, since the bulk polymerization is mainly used at the time of manufacturing the polyalkylene carbonate, reaction time is long or side reactions largely occur, such that after the polymerization is completed, post-treatment processes are essentially required. However, in the present invention, after the polymerization is completed, since it is easy to perform control of self-polymerization, removal of a polymer from a reactor, and removal of metal residue in the polymer, the method of the present invention is more advantageous for performing the post-treatment processes as compared to the bulk polymerization. 
     In addition, even though polymerization activity of the catalyst according to the method of the present invention corresponds to ⅓ of that of the existing bulk polymerization; however, according to the present invention, excellent thermal stability may be secured and a degree of polymerization may be easily adjusted. 
     In particular, in the present invention, high carbonate linkage is maintained and after the reaction, TSC of solution is decreased to maintain viscosity of the solution at a relatively low state, such that it is easy to transfer the polymer solution to the post-treatment process. In addition, according to the present invention, additional processes such as removing catalyst residue from the polymer may be easily performed. 
     In the solution-polymerizing method according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the specific solvent is deduced according to a method of directly polymerization screening candidate solvents. The specific solvent is preferably selected from the group consisting of ethylene dichloride, benzene and hexane as described above. 
     Since the ethylene dichloride has solubility to the polyalkylene carbonate, after the polymerization is completed, the polycarbonate may be contained in the solvent, such that the transfer is smoothly performed. Therefore, according to the present invention, since the final polymer may be transferred in a state in which the polymer is contained in the solution, a problem that the polyalkylene carbonate prepared by the existing bulk polymerization has a low mobility may be solved. 
     In addition, even though hexane is insoluble to the polyalkylene carbonate, the solution-polymerization is achieved, such that after the polymerization is completed, the final polymer may be simply obtained by removing hexane through filtration. 
     Here, if using other solvents at the time of solution-polymerization, since deactivation of the catalyst is accelerated and the polymerization reaction is not performed at all, the polyalkylene carbonate including a binary copolymer of the epoxide compound and carbon dioxide may not be prepared. 
     The solvent is preferably used at a weight ratio of 1:0.1 to 1:20 based on the epoxide compound. Here, when the ratio is less than 1:0.1, which is extremely decreased, as the polymerization proceeds, TSC and viscosity are rapidly increased, such that the polymerization reaction is not uniformly performed, and mechanical overload occurs in a motor of the reactor, and therefore, the effect of the solution-polymerization may not be shown. In addition, when the ratio is more than 1:20, yield and molecular weight are decreased. 
     In a preferred exemplary embodiment of the present invention, the catalyst represented by Chemical Formula 1 above is a cobalt complex having a neutral single-site catalyst, and may have high reactivity and selectivity as compared to the existing complex used as the catalyst at the time of copolymerization of the polyalkylene carbonate. 
     In the complex represented by Chemical Formula 1, X is more preferably —NO 3  or —OAc. 
     In addition, in Chemical Formula 1 above, R 1 , R 3 , R 5  and R 7  are each independently hydrogen or a C1-C20 alkyl group, or more preferably, hydrogen or a C1-C10 alkyl group, and R 2 , R 4  and R 6  are each independently a C1-C20 alkyl group, or more preferably, a C1-C10 alkyl group. Most preferably, R 1 , R 3 , R 5  and R 7  are each independently hydrogen, and R 2 , R 4  and R 6  are each independently a tert-butyl group. 
     Further, in Chemical Formula 1 above, n may be an integer of 1 to 10, and more preferably, an integer of 2 to 5. 
     In Chemical Formula 1 above, Q may be C3-C20 cycloalkylene, and more preferably, a 1,2-cyclohexylene group. 
     Therefore, the complex of the present invention may have a structure represented by the following Chemical Formula 1-1 according to the preferred exemplary embodiment: 
     
       
         
         
             
             
         
       
     
     in Chemical Formula 1-1, X is —NO 3  or —OAc. 
     In addition, the catalyst may be used at a molar ratio of 1:500 to 100000 based on the epoxide compound, and more preferably, at a molar ratio of 1:10000 to 1:60000. Here, when the ratio is less than 1:500 based on the catalyst, an amount of the used catalyst is large, such that it is not easy to remove the catalyst after the polymerization, and after performing the polymerization, catalyst residue may induce back biting. In addition, when the ratio is more than 1:100,000 based on the catalyst, the catalyst has a low concentration, such that the reaction time is long and final yield is decreased. 
     Further, the epoxide compound in the present invention may be at least one kind selected from the group consisting of C2-C20 alkylene oxide substituted or unsubstituted with halogen or a C1-C5 alkyl group; C4-C20 cycloalkylene oxide substituted or unsubstituted with halogen or a C1-C5 alkyl group; and C8-C20 styrene oxide substituted or unsubstituted with halogen or a C1-C5 alkyl group. More preferably, the epoxide compound includes C2-C20 alkylene oxide substituted or unsubstituted with halogen or a C1-C5 alkyl group, and has a carbonate linkage selectivity of 99% or more. 
     In addition, specific examples of the epoxide compound according to the present invention include ethylene oxide, propylene oxide, butene oxide, pentene oxide, hexene oxide, octene oxide, decene oxide, dodecene oxide, tetradecene oxide, hexadecene oxide, octadecene oxide, butadiene monoxide, 1,2-epoxy-7-octene, epifluorohydrin, epichlorohydrin, epibromohydrin, isopropyl glycidyl ether, butyl glycidyl ether, t-butyl glycidyl ether, 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether, allyl glycidyl ether, cyclopentene oxide, cyclohexene oxide, cyclooctene oxide, cyclododecene oxide, alpha-pinene oxide, 2,3-epoxynorbornene, limonene oxide, dieldrin, 2,3-epoxypropylbenzene, styrene oxide, phenylpropylene oxide, stilbene oxide, chlorostilbene oxide, dichlorostilbene oxide, 1,2-epoxy-3-phenoxypropane, benzyloxymethyl oxirane, glycidyl-methylphenyl ether, chlorophenyl-2,3-epoxypropyl ether, epoxypropyl methoxyphenyl ether, biphenyl glycidyl ether, glycidyl naphthyl ether, and the like. Preferably, the epoxide compound is ethylene oxide. 
     In addition, in the solution-polymerizing, an ammonium salt selected from the group consisting of (n-Bu) 4 NY (wherein Y═Cl or OAc), [PPN]Cl, [PPN]Br and [PPN]N 3  may be further included as a cocatalyst. 
     Further, in the method of manufacturing the polyalkylene carbonate according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, examples of the method of polymerizing the polyalkylene carbonate include batch type polymerization, a semi-batch type polymerization, or continuous type polymerization. 
     In addition, the carbon dioxide may be injected at a weight ratio of 0.5:1 to 10:1 based on the epoxide compound. 
     Further, a pressure of the carbon dioxide in the solution-polymerization manufacturing the polyalkylene carbonate may be 100 atmospheric pressure at normal pressure, and preferably, 2 to 50 atmospheric pressure. 
     The carbon dioxide may be continuously or non-continuously injected during the reaction; however, the continuous injection is preferred, and in this case, a semi-batch type or a closed batch system is preferably used as a polymerization reactor. At the time of continuously injecting the carbon dioxide in the polymerization, reaction pressure may be 5 to 50 bar, or 10 to 40 bar. 
     Meanwhile, the solution-polymerization may be performed at a temperature of 50 to 100° C. In addition, since self-polymerization temperature of the epoxide compound, preferably, ethylene oxide is 90° C., the solution-polymerization is more preferably performed at a temperature of 60 to 80 t in order to decrease an amount of by-products such as polyalkylene glycol, and the like, caused by the self-polymerization. 
     Further, experiments known in the related art state that time required for the polymerization is 20 hours or more; however, in this case, the polymerization reaction time is excessively long, which is not desirable, and at the time of the reaction at a high temperature for a long time (for example, 20 hours), cyclic carbonate is formed by back biting on a medium, and a molecular weight of the thus-obtained polymer may be rather decreased. 
     However, with the combination of the above-described solvent with the catalyst at the time of solution-polymerization according to the present invention, the polymerization reaction may be performed for 6 hours or less, and more preferably, 30 minutes to 9 hours, and the most preferably, 3 to 5 hours. That is, according to the present invention, the epoxide compound may have the same level of conversion ratio as that of the related art even with a short polymerization time, and the by-products may be less formed. 
     The polyalkylene carbonate prepared by one exemplary embodiment of the present invention is a binary copolymer of ethylene oxide and carbon dioxide, and may include polyethylene carbonate having a weight average molecular weight of 1000 to 500,000. In addition, according to the present invention, TOF of the polyalkylene carbonate is 300 to 1500 (mol/mol-cat·hr), and since the number of reacting molecules per unit activity point per a unit time is large, sufficient activity for manufacturing the polyalkylene carbonate may be shown. 
     Hereinafter, preferably exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail. However, these examples are only to illustrate the present invention and are not to be construed as limiting a scope of the present invention.

     It could be confirmed from Tables 1 and 2 above that when the solution-polymerization is performed by using the catalyst having a neutral singe-site and 1,2-EDC or hexane as the solvent, the copolymerization of EO/CO 2  could be generated. Therefore, it could be confirmed that the 1,2-EDC or hexane has significantly decreased deactivation effect on the catalyst itself, and also has solubility or non-solubility to the polyalkylene carbonate, in particular, polyethylene carbonate, respectively, and therefore, when manufacturing the polyalkylene carbonate by the solution-polymerization, the 1,2-EDC or hexane is sufficiently useful as the solvent. 
     In addition, as shown in  FIGS. 1 and 2 , it could be confirmed from Examples 1 and 2 that alternate copolymerization of the ethylene oxide and the carbon dioxide was favorably achieved to prepare the polyethylene carbonate. Further, it could be confirmed that even at the time of solution-polymerization, addition peaks of polyalkylene glycol, cyclic carbonate, and the like, were shown as a trace amount which is less than 1% based on the combination of the polyalkylene carbonate. 
     Meanwhile, when using the solvent of Comparative Examples 1 to 6, the copolymerization was not achieved at all, such that yield and TOF results could not be measured. Therefore, it could be confirmed that even though the solvent is polar or non-polar, when the specific solvent is not used at the time of solution-polymerization, the polyalkylene carbonate could not be prepared.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     As discussed herein, various experiments have been conducted to examine the suitability of different compositions when forming particles, particularly sub-micronic polymer fibers. 
     In general, the term “particles” as used herein includes fibers (e.g., filaments, ligaments, etc.), droplets, and other shapes made from any suitable liquid and which may at least partially solidify, evaporate, and/or in some cases remain at least partially in liquid form. 
     “Electrospinning” as used conventionally refers to the production of particles (e.g., fibers or droplets) that are “spun” as fibers or “sprayed” as droplets by applying high electric fields to one or more fluid spraying or spinning tips (also called emitters or spinnerets). 
     During electrospinning, the sprayed droplets or spun fibers are typically collected on a target substrate or collector plate positioned away from the emitters. A high voltage supply provides an electric potential difference (and hence the electrostatic field) between the emitter (usually at a high voltage) and the target substrate (usually grounded). 
     It is often desirable to produce particles of very small sizes, particularly particles having a diameter less than 1 micrometer (i.e., sub-micronic fibers), since such particles can be commercially quite valuable. Theoretically this should be possible with known electrospinning processes based on results that have been achieved in a laboratory environment. However, in practice, scaling up an electrospinning process beyond the laboratory has proven to be problematic, particularly when trying to produce large quantities of very small particles. 
     Scott et al. in US Patent Application Publication No. 2012/0004370 describe the use of a low dielectric constant polymer dissolved in a low dielectric constant solvent. For the purposes of this application, this will be referred to as a “low dielectric contrast system” where the bulk constituents (polymer and solvent) have similar and low dielectric constants. The low dielectric constant solvent is supplemented with high dielectric additives to create a mixture with an overall high dielectric property and responsive to an electric field (i.e., the additives provide the elevated dielectric property). These low dielectric contrast mixtures display relatively good fiber formation when released into a strong electric field. The mixtures generally had a low conductivity that was below the range of conductivity usually associated with electrospinning. However, while the rates of fiber production seem high by conventional standards, they were still low when compared to desired commercial production rates. 
     Koslow et al. in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/682,894 filed on Aug. 14, 2012 describe methods of forming particles in which a strong force (centripetal or viscous drag forces) are used to convert a polymer melt into a pre-particle consisting of a relatively large filament of (in some cases) 10-30 micrometers in diameter. The mixture includes a base polymer compound and a dielectric additive having an elevated dielectric constant dispersed therein. The pre-particles are subjected to an electrostatic field to further attenuate the pre-particles and form particles of a desired size. What Koslow demonstrates here is that dielectrophoretic spinning is possible if a pre-particle is made available. This is important because unlike electrospinning, it is often very difficult to cause a fiber to emerge from bulk liquid as a result of the formation of a conventional Taylor cone. Once the pre-particle is created, the dielectrophoretic force is efficient to perform further attenuation of the particle with minimal applied electric energy. The entire contents of this application are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. 
     Koslow et al. in U.S. Provisional Patent Application No. 61/713,000 filed on Oct. 12, 2012 describe a dielectrophoretic spinning process in which compositions include a polymer dissolved in a solvent with a much higher dielectric constant. These compositions seem to be particularly suitable for generating particles of small size at good production rates, especially in the case when the polymer itself has an elevated dielectric constant. Furthermore, the presence of one or more high-dielectric additives within the polymer/solvent mixture appear to help further reduce the size of the resulting particles. The entire contents of this application are incorporated by reference herein for all purposes. 
     The teachings herein are generally directed at further techniques that may be useful for increasing particle production rates, or reducing particle sizes, or both. The phenomenon called dielectrophoretic spinning (or “D-spinning”) is discussed, which generally refers to a process in which the properties of a composition (particularly its dielectric properties) are selected to encourage the formation of very small particles through “dielectrophoretic attenuation”, namely by action of the dielectrophoretic forces acting on the composition (and which are generally unrelated to the conductivity of the composition). In some cases, dielectrophoretic spinning may actually be improved where the conductivity of the composition is low, as this may enhance the power available for dielectrophoretic forces. 
     It has been discovered that dielectrophoretic spinning can generate relatively small particles at relatively large production rates when the composition includes a polymer of high dielectric constant dissolved into a solvent that has a high dielectric constant (sometimes in the presence of high dielectric additives). Polymers with a low dielectric constant can also be used if the solvent and additives have much higher dielectric constants. However, when the solvent and the polymer have widely varying dielectric properties, this often means that they are not compatible and one will not dissolve in the other. The present application may be beneficial at addressing this problem and in fact, it was surprisingly discovered that it appears that this incompatibility can be turned to advantage. In summary, the dielectric constant of the solvent is higher, and when possible much higher, than the dielectric constant of the polymer, while the dielectric constant of the additives may be even higher (in some cases quite substantially higher). 
     The resulting compositions where the solvent/additive or additive have much higher dielectric constants than the polymer may be referred to herein as a “high dielectric contrast systems” and it is believed that these types of compositions are suitable for forming large quantities of small particles, particularly sub-micronic polymer fibers. 
     One problem with prior approaches is that high dielectric solvents will generally not dissolve or disperse polymers of much lower dielectric constant. Effectively, the Hansen Solubility Parameter for polarization of the two compounds are not similar. This usually means that the dispersive and hydrogen bonding parameters are also not matching. In the past, this failure to match has been considered a barrier to using any such mixtures for conventional electrospinning. That is, if the polymer does not dissolve in the solvent, the mixture was considered to be useless. 
     It has now been surprisingly discovered that this problem can be addressed by the use of a dispersant, by careful selection of the solvent, or by heating the mixture (or by some combination thereof). In some cases, as described herein when heating is severe and approaching or even exceeding the melting point of the polymer, these incompatible conditions can be resolved. 
     Notably, the fact that the solvent and polymer are incompatible appears to create an opportunity to obtain extremely high dielectric contrast between the polymer micelles (where the polymer is tightly coiled as a result of the remaining incompatibility with the surrounding solvent) and the surrounding solvent and additives. This micro-dispersion of the two phases with dramatically different dielectric properties creates the high dielectric contrast that can produce very good dielectrophoretic spinning results. 
     During a dielectrophoretic spinning process, it is desirable that the solvent be at least partially removed such that the finished polymer particles are normally substantially free of solvent. The mechanism for solvent removal in these systems is believed to be at least in part related to the ratio of the dielectric constants of the polymer and solvent as also amended by any additives. 
     Generally, it is understood that the dielectrophoretic forces acting upon an object increase by the square of the magnitude of the electric field gradient and in roughly direct proportion to the dielectric contrast of the dispersed phase vs. the dielectric constant of the continuous phase through an equation sometimes called the Pohl Equation. 
     Scott et al. have previously shown it may be possible to mechanically remove the solvent from the lower dielectric polymer phase using the dielectrophoretic differences between these two materials. Specifically, Scott et al. describe low dielectric constant polymers dissolved in low dielectric constant solvents that have been enhanced with high dielectric additives. The result can help drive physical separation of the solvent from the polymer due to differences in the dielectrophoretic forces acting on the different constituent parts. Scott et al. refer to this process as “solvent ejection”. Note, however, that in the Scott system, the solvent and polymer had roughly similar dielectric constants as one could not dissolve the other if the difference was greater than some reasonable limit. In the Scott system it was the additives, therefore, that were the source of the strong spinning forces and solvent-ejecting forces. 
     However, it has been determined that the approach of Scott et al. may not be suitable when trying to generate large quantities of small particles. In particular, it has been observed that the dielectric contrast between the two main phases of the system—the solvent and the polymer—has a major influence on creating strong attenuation forces. Scott missed this because he was unable to create stable mixtures of high dielectric contrast. In fact, his mixtures are meta-stable and react to elevated atmospheric moisture or other conditions to precipitate. Scott&#39;s low dielectric contrast approach may thus be far less productive than the high dielectric contrast systems as described herein for example. In addition, the solvents usable in the Scott approach are limited to those that roughly match the Hansen Solubility Parameters of the polymer. 
     According to the present teachings, compositions where the solvent/additive or simply the additive added to the polymer have much higher dielectric properties than the polymer (i.e. where the solvent and polymer have dramatically different dielectric constants) provide much better results, especially in regard to the volume of fibers produced. Basically, dissolving the polymer in a solvent of similar dielectric constant has wasted a now discovered opportunity to build dielectric contrast and enhance the available spin forces. 
     It has in fact been observed that it is usually better to make large leaps in dielectric constant at each step and thereby build large dielectrophoretic forces efficiently. Using a base polymer with an elevated dielectric constant may also allow much higher spin rates. 
     The use of high dielectric compositions as described herein seems to result in higher production rates and in some cases production rates may be five, fifty or even many more times as high as other known electrospinning processes or the Scott teachings. 
     In general, the maximum rate of fiber production is believed to be roughly proportional to the dielectric constant of the polymer and the dielectric contrast of this polymer with the surrounding solvent/additive or additive. To build further contrast, one can build a “dielectric ladder” usually consisting of a candidate polymer of relatively low dielectric constant, dissolved or dispersed into a solvent with a much higher dielectric constant, wherein this mixture is further amended with one or more additives that are present in progressively smaller amounts, but have progressively higher and higher dielectric constants. Other ingredients might include a dispersant to enhance polymer dispersion within the mixture as well as surfactants to adjust surface tension or co-solvents to obtain lower viscosity. 
     In some embodiments, one or more high dielectric additives can be included within the solvent to further enhance the total effective dielectric contrast of the composition. In some such embodiments, the dielectric additives may have dielectric constants many times higher than the dielectric constants of either the solvent or the polymer, or both. In some specific instances, the dielectric constant of the additives may be above 100, 1000, 10,000, or even above 100,000. 
     In some embodiments, the solvent may include one or more of the following solvents: acetone, acetonitrile, acetophenone, acetyl chloride, acrylonitrile, gamma-butyrolectone, cyclohexanone, N,N-dimethylacetamide, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, 1,4-Dioxane, ethylene glycol, ethyl formate, formamide, formic acid, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone, N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone, nitromethane, 2-Nitropropane, propylene-1,2-carbonate, tetrahydrofuran, tetramethylurea, triethyl phosphate, and trimethyl phosphate. In general these and many other solvents have a high dielectric constant, and/or dissolve or swell particular polymers (e.g., polycarbonate, PVDF, styrene, polyesters, polyamides, polyacrylics, polyetherimides). In some cases, these solvents may requite elevated temperatures to accomplish the desired degree of dispersion. 
     In some specific embodiments, a high dielectric composition may not include any low dielectric components whatsoever. Such compositions may allow for production rates that are much higher (e.g., 5,000 to 100,000 times or more) than known electrospinning or the Scott technologies. 
     For example, the use of high dielectric compositions may yield sub-micronic fibres of very small diameter at rates of roughly 300-1,000 grams per minute per linear meter of beam. Traditional solvent-based electrospinning from a needle typically operates at flow rates of about 0.1-1.0 milliliter per hour and resulting in only a fraction of a gram of dry fibre per hour. In contrast, the current dielectrophoretic system in the same geometry might flow at up to 40 milliliters per hour and produce up to 8 grams per hour of dry 150-250 nanometer fiber (i.e., up to 400 times greater rates of production). However, when using a spinning rotor apparatus as shown and described herein, this production rate can be increased to 40 milliliters/minute of a solvent-based system, which is 24,000 times greater production. If the current system involves a molten polymer with a high dielectric contrast additive, the production rate of dry fiber from a single rotor can be up to 40 grams/minute, which is nearly 100,000 times greater than obtained from a traditional needle-based electrospinning emitter. Using a melt spray or melt blowing apparatus, this production rate can be further increased to greater than 1.00 Kg/minute, with spin rates of 0.5 grams/minute-hole being typical. 
     The use of high dielectric contrast systems may also have other advantages. For instance, some compositions can make use of highly polar compounds that are not strongly influenced by local temperature or humidity conditions during the spinning process. The resulting fibers and particles made using the current dielectrophoretic spinning can have high temperature resistance, high solvent resistance, can be extremely hydrophobic, and could in some cases be used to produce super-hydrophobic and oleophobic surfaces. 
     Moreover, such compositions may be generally nontoxic and of low flammability making them safe to handle during manufacturing. In fact, some particularly suitable solvents, if solvents are used, may be specifically selected for low vapor pressure even at elevated temperatures. 
     These compositions may also eliminate (or at least reduce) problems associated with orifice clogging and cleaning in conventional electrospinning equipment. Many of suitable solvents as generally described herein have extremely low vapor pressure at room temperature and do not significantly evaporate when exposed to the atmosphere. Such solvents would not be useful in electrospinning where the solvent must evaporate during fiber formation. When the solvent is instead mechanically eliminated during spinning by alternative means (mechanical ejection), the solvent can be selected for low vapor pressure, low flammability, low toxicity, and low cost. Clogging, typically caused by the premature evaporation of the solvent, which leaves polymer debris that clogs critical orifices, generally does not occur when the solvent has low vapor pressure. 
     In some cases, the resulting fibers or particles can be controlled and directed to a counter-electrode in a manner similar to electrostatic coating of paints. However, in many cases, dielectrophoretic spinning can be done in open air using a “monopolar” source where there is no immediately apparent counter electrode. In such cases, the fibers can be released into a surrounding airstream, entrained within this moving airstream, and collected onto a screen or wire in a manner similar to a common air laid process. There is often no need for elaborate fiber separation as the fibers are generally in the form of a loose cloud and the fibers often repel each other during their production and thus avoid forming agglomerates. 
     In one exemplary embodiment, poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF) may be used as an example of a high dielectric polymer, with a dielectric constant of roughly 8-12 (in contrast, most polyolefins or polystyrene have significantly lower dielectric constants of roughly 2-3). The PVDF resin can be dissolved within a solvent system that includes one or more high dielectric solvents, such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or other co-solvents. The solvent/polymer mixture can be further enhanced by the addition of a high dielectric additive, such as 50 nanometer barium titanate powder (with a dielectric constant of around 1750). 
     The resulting high dielectric composition can be fed through a glass pipette with a 1 mm orifice and having a submerged wire within the composition (sustained at a distance from the opening of the pipette) to apply an electric field to the fluid. Applying a voltage between this submerged electrode and a suitable counter electrode at a distance D from the opening of the pipette can result in particles that are attenuated into small (particularly sub-micronic) particles. 
     Turning now to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , illustrated therein is a schematic representation of an apparatus  10  for forming particles using high dielectric contrast systems according to one embodiment. 
     The apparatus  10  generally includes at least one rotating surface, which in this embodiment is a rotating disk  12  with an upper surface  14 . The apparatus  10  also includes a feed chamber or dispenser  16 . As shown, the dispenser  16  is generally at or near the center of the disk  12  (e.g., at the axis of rotation A of the disk  12 ) and serves as a source for the liquid composition used to feed the rotating upper surface  14  of the apparatus  10 . 
     In particular, a composition or mixture of high dielectric polymer and high dielectric solvent (indicated generally as M) may be deposited from the dispenser  16  onto the upper surface  14  of disk  12  generally at the axis of rotation A. The deposited mixture M will then flow outwardly across the disk surface  14  (generally as a thin film) due to the centrifugal forces generated by rotation of the disk  12 . 
     Under the appropriate operating conditions (e.g., suitable rotational speeds, mixture feed rates, etc.), upon reaching the edge  18 , the liquid mixture M will separate from the surface  14  of the disk  12  to form particles (indicated generally as P). These particles P may include fibers (e.g., filaments, ligaments, fibrils, etc.), droplets, or particles of various other shapes and sizes. 
     An electrostatic field is applied to these particles P to further attenuate them. For example, an electrostatic field may be generated between the disk  12  and a collector plate  20  positioned below the disk  12 . Due to the electric field, and when the liquid mixture M has suitable properties, the particles P ejected from the disk  12  will further attenuate within the electric field so as to be further reduced in size. 
     For example, particles P may be ejected from the disk  12  with a size greater than one micron in diameter (e.g., greater than one micron but generally less than fifty microns), and then be further attenuated within the region surrounding the disk. The attenuation is caused by dielectrophoretic forces that drive fiber diameter down to less than one micron (in some cases, significantly less than one micron). 
     The particles P will normally be drawn down by the electrostatic field and deposit on a top surface of the collector plate  20 , in some cases forming a particle mat T on the collector plate  20 . 
     In some embodiments, an estimate of the electrostatic field strength for the apparatus  10  may be indirectly determined by a voltage-distance quotient, shown here as the disk-to-collector distance DCD between the collector plate  20  and the disk  12 . However, this appears to be less important in dielectrophoretic spinning as these forces are the result of the non-uniform electric field gradient near the space where the fiber is formed. The presence of a counter-electrode may thus be almost unimportant. In fact, if this counter-electrode is eliminated, the process tends to continue unabated. 
     In some cases, hot air can be used to heat the disk  12  or dispenser  16  (or both) to maintain the mixture M in a desired liquid state and more particularly at a temperature and viscosity that encourages the formation of small and stable particles P that separate from the edge  18  of the disk  12 . The application of heat is also a primary means to cause solvents and polymer mixtures to successfully operate together when this may be impossible at room temperature. 
     Turning now to  FIG. 3 , illustrated therein is another apparatus  100  for producing particles using a high dielectric composition according to another embodiment. The apparatus  100  generally includes a nozzle  102  (i.e., the emitter) with an orifice  104  at its distal end, and which is configured to emit the high dielectric contrast composition. 
     The nozzle  102  may be supported by an insulating stand  106  or other suitable structure that electrically isolates the nozzle  102  from its surroundings. In some embodiments, the nozzle  102  may be made from more electrically insulating materials such as glass, plastic, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), nylon, or other suitable insulating material that is also chemically compatible with the high dielectric composition. In some embodiments, a conducting nozzle material may also be suitable. 
     In some cases, the nozzle  102  can act as a reservoir for the high dielectric composition, or can communicate with a fluid reservoir that stores the high dielectric composition. In some embodiments, multiple nozzles  102  can be employed concurrently although only one nozzle  102  is shown here for clarity. 
     In general, the orifice  104  can be configured so as to provide a suitable level of hydrodynamic resistance to the flow of the composition to obtain a desired composition feed rate. 
     In some embodiments, flow of fluid through the nozzle  102  can be driven by gravity (e.g., by arranging for a suitable fluid head above the nozzle orifice  104 ), or flow can be driven by a pump (e.g., a syringe pump) or other flow-regulating device. When dielectrophoretic forces are used, the fluid is drawn from the capillary by polarization in the electric gradient. This “pumping action” will draw the fluid from the capillary in a measured fashion and as described herein the flow rate actually moves by this natural pumping action. 
     Pumping is the result of a high dielectric fluid being drawn toward the region of highest field gradient. Under high-speed video examination, this pumping action can have a distinct high-frequency pulsation that is likely caused by the resonance resulting within the spin circuit where there is a resistance through the fluid and a capacitance for the surrounding electrodes. In the capillary tube apparatus, this RC resonance is often around 1000 Hz. 
     In some embodiments, a capillary tube (e.g., a PTFE capillary tube) can be inserted into the nozzle  102  so that one end of the capillary tube restricts the flow at the orifice  104  and the other end of the capillary tube communicates with the interior of the nozzle  102  or with a fluid reservoir. The dielectrophoretic forces experienced at the nozzle tip draw fluid out of the nozzle  102  and can therefore act as a pump. The smaller PTFE tube prevents excess fluid emerging as a result of gravity. 
     During use, a power supply  110  applies a voltage to the fluid composition, for example through an insulated or shielded cable  112  and an electrode  114  that may be immersed in the fluid composition (e.g., within the nozzle  102 ), usually at a significant distance from the orifice  104 . This electrode can also be positioned near the fluid, but in open air, to induce polarization. The electrode can also be placed an extended distance away while immersed in the fluid. In one experiment, the electrode was placed approximately 40 feet away down a 0.25″ I.D. plastic tube and the fluid successfully was spun from the other end of the tubing. This “spooky” capability to cause spinning through a good insulator at such a distance appears to be a characteristic of dielectrophoretic spinning. 
     During use, when a suitable fluid composition is exposed to a sufficient voltage, particles will be emitted from the orifice  104  and drawn down by an electrostatic field and deposited on a top surface of a collector plate  130 . Generally as with the apparatus  10 , dielectrophoretic forces acting on the particles will attenuate the particles down to a desired size, in some cases sub-micronic sizes. 
     The arrangement of the apparatus  100  illustrated in  FIG. 3  includes a surface  126  that is grounded through a ground connection  128  that is not directly connected to ground connection  118  of the power supply  110 . It will of course be appreciated that other configurations for the apparatus  100  are possible. 
     EXPERIMENTS 
     General Comments 
     As discussed in further detail below, various experiments were conducted by exposing different compositions to an electrostatic field and observing the resulting particle sizes. Specifically, experiments were conducted to observe the performance of several high dielectric contrast systems that included a high dielectric polymer such as poly(vinylidene difluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) [P(VDF-HFP)] in the dielectrophoretic spinning processes. For simplicity, P(VDF-HFP) may simply be referred to herein as simply PVDF. Some of these experiments were performed using an apparatus generally similar to the apparatus  100  described with reference to  FIG. 3  above using an applied voltage of −37.5 kV and a distance, d, of 9 cm. 
     A relative assessment of different dielectrophoretic spinning experiments was performed by comparing observed results (e.g., fiber output measured in grams per hour (g/h), fiber size, the nature and/or characteristics of particle formation, etc.). 
     In some cases, a composition with high dielectric materials may be considered to be relatively more effective at producing fibers if the resulting fiber output (i.e. as measured in grams/hour) is greater, or the fiber size is generally smaller than that obtained from another composition, or both. 
     It was believed that PVDF would perform well in the presence of an electrostatic field since PVDF has a relatively high dielectric constant for a polymer and thus should be highly influenced by dielectrophoretic forces. Specifically, the dielectric constant ∈ r  for PVDF is between about 8 and 12. 
     As discussed, the PVDF was dissolved in a high dielectric constant solvent that included at least some dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). DMSO is an effective solvent that dissolves a wide variety of chemical compounds, including PVDF. DMSO also has a low toxicity and is not flammable. DMSO also has a relatively high dielectric constant (∈ r ≈47), which suggests that it would be highly influenced by dielectrophoretic forces according to the theories as generally described herein. 
     Initial experiments were aimed at determining if a composition that included PVDF dissolved in DMSO would be suitable to achieve good particle sizes and production rates. 
     Subsequent experiments then looked at whether the introduction of high dielectric additives, such as barium titanate (BaTiO 3 , ∈ r ≈1750) would improve the results (e.g., higher fiber output, smaller fiber size, etc.) 
     Additional experiments with other solvents, surfactants, and variations in the percentages of PVDF were also undertaken to investigate the effect of varying dielectric constants, viscosity, surface tension, fiber diameter, fiber output, and formation of sprays, droplets, and/or wet fibers. 
     For reference, Table 1 lists various substances discussed herein, along with their associated dielectric constants, vapor pressures, and boiling points.

     A K2850-04 in DMSO Solution 
     In a first experiment, four tests (1a through 1d) were conducted using a P(VDF-HFP) co-polymer called K2850-04 dissolved in a DMSO solution. K2850-04 is a Kynar Flex product produced by Arkema Inc. (King of Prussia, Pa., USA). 
     The concentration of K2850-04 was increased from 15 wt % to 21 wt % in increments of 2%. Fibers were obtained from each test, and observations are presented in Table 2:

     A significant amount of wet spray was observed for the first test, and the fibers that did form contained “beads-on-a-string” formations. For the tests reported in experiment 1, poor fiber quality resulted in an inability to quantify the fiber output. The K2850-04 concentration was then increased to 17 wt % in an attempt to increase the viscosity of the solution and eliminate bead formation. The qualitative fiber output and amount of spray was similar with 15 wt % K2850-04, although the K2850-04 crystallized more readily making the mixture more difficult to handle. 
     Increasing the K2850-04 concentration to 19 wt % resulted in a lower fiber output and produced more droplets and spray. 
     The formulation with 21 wt % K2850-04 resulted in no fibers visible to the eye. The 21 wt % K2850-04 formulation was too viscous to spin well and also crystallized easily and quickly. Qualitatively, the fiber output was lower and there was more spray than for the formulation with 19 wt % K2850-04. Furthermore, the increase in K2850-04 above 19 wt % did not eliminate the formation of beads. 
     Experiment 2 
     Solution with High-Dielectric BaTiO 3  Additive 
     For the second experiment, barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ) was added to the composition (0.5 wt %) as a high-dielectric additive. Four tests (2a through 2d) were conducted, with two tests 2a and 2b with a K2850-04 concentration of 15%. These resulting observations are presented in Table 3:

     The fiber output increased for a mixture with BaTiO 3  (2b) relative to the mixture without BaTiO 3  (1a), which is consistent with the very high dielectrophoretic forces that would be acting on the barium titanate particles. It was possible to remove the PTFE insert from the nozzle and increase the solution flow rate (2b) while preserving an average fiber size around 250 nm. 
     Of particular interest, the increased fiber output (2b) was high in comparison to the output observed in low dielectric spinning reported by Scott et al., which is believed to be correlated to the positive effects of the high dielectric constant of the PVDF polymer. 
     The K2850-04 concentration was increased in test 2c to determine the effect of increased resin loading. 
     At 17 wt % K2850-04, the viscosity increased slightly and qualitatively, and the fiber output dropped slightly. 
     Increasing the K2850-04 concentration up to 19 wt % (in test 2d) raised the viscosity sufficiently high such that that the solution was not spinnable and did not produce particles. Accordingly, a K2850-04 concentration of around 15 wt % to 17 wt % may be a good operating range for high dielectric compositions with DMSO and BaTiO 3  in some cases. 
     The BaTiO 3  also delays the time required for the K2850-04 to crystallize, which causes the mixture to change to a solid-like gel. The formation of the gel is reversible, and a liquid state is achievable by heating and stirring the mixture. This reversibility property is true for all formulations that follow. 
     Experiment 3 
     DMSO and Acetone Solvents 
     The third experiment included two tests, 3a and 3b, and involved dissolving the polymer in a solvent mixture that included both DMSO and acetone. The first test 3a was conducted without the high-dielectric additive, barium titanate BaTiO 3 , while the second test 3b added the high-dielectric additive. Observations for this experiment are presented in Table 4:

     The addition of acetone, a solvent with a dielectric constant (∈ r ≈21) less than DMSO (∈ r ≈47) positively increased the fiber output and reduced the amount of spray produced during spinning. The reduction in spray may be attributable to the higher vapor pressure and lower boiling point of acetone in comparison to DMSO. 
     The increase in fiber output may be related to the addition of a dielectric material with a dielectric constant in between the dielectric constant of DMSO and PVDF. In addition, it is suspected that the addition of the moderate dielectric material also reduces the bulk viscosity of the mixture such that it improves the spinnability of the mixture. 
     However, one observed effect of adding acetone to the composition was a corresponding increase in fiber size. Thus, while the acetone helped eliminate beads, it also simultaneously appears to increase the fiber size. This may be due to the acetone evaporating early in the spinning process, resulting in increased viscosity of the composition prior to the formation of the fibers and thus reducing the amount of fiber attenuation. This may also be due to the composition having a lower overall dielectric constant, and thus being less affected by dielectrophoretic forces. 
     Acetone also further delays the time required for the K2850-04 to crystallize. 
     Experiment 4 
     DMSO and MEK Solvents 
     In an attempt to reduce the fiber size, but maintain the fiber output and maintain or further reduce the spray, other dielectric solvents were selected as alternatives to acetone in this experiment. The selected solvents have slightly higher boiling points and moderate vapor pressures, and are known to dissolve PVDF. 
     Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) may be desirable since it has similar solvating properties as acetone and is less expensive than DMSO. Furthermore, the vapor pressure of MEK is lower and the boiling point is higher than acetone, which should result in a slower evaporation of MEK during the spinning process, culminating in fibers with a smaller diameter. 
     Experiment 4 included nine tests, 4a through 4i, using a solvent mixture that combined DMSO and MEK. For the first test 4a, no BaTiO 3  was used. For tests 4b through 4f, concentrations of K2850-04 and BaTiO 3  were held somewhat constant while concentrations of DMSO and MEK were varied. In the remaining tests, 4g through 4i, K2850-04 content was decreased. Observations for this experiment are presented in Table 5:

     In comparing the formulations without BaTiO 3 , the MEK formulation of test 4a demonstrated a decrease in fiber diameter and an increase in fiber output in contrast to the corresponding acetone formulation of test 3a. The higher boiling point and lower vapor pressure of MEK may contribute to a reduction in evaporation during the early spinning stages and a lower viscosity solution that produces smaller diameter fibers. The lower viscosity may also lead to the slightly higher fiber output. 
     The addition of BaTiO 3  to the MEK mixture (test 4b) again resulted in an increase in fiber output, while the fiber diameter also decreased in comparison to the acetone formulation of test 3b. 
     The MEK/BaTiO 3  composition appeared to provide for good fiber production rates and good fiber sizes. Additional experiments (4d-4f) were carried out to determine if the DMSO concentration could be lowered to reduce the cost of the formulation and possibly further improve the spinning properties by having a higher concentration of more readily evaporative solvent in comparison to DMSO. 
     Once the DMSO concentration is lowered to 20:80 DMSO/MEK (test 4f), the spinning performance drops, perhaps because there is not a sufficient amount of DMSO present. 
     The fiber diameter does not seem to change dramatically with the increased amount of MEK. At elevated concentrations of MEK, porosity within the fiber itself emerges due to the phase separation of the polymer between the two solvents. 
     Decreasing the PVDF concentration from 18 (4e) to 14-16 (4g &amp; 4h) wt % reduced the mixture viscosity and reduced the fiber size. A further reduction in PVDF concentration (4i) resulted in a mixture viscosity that was too low to support fiber formation. 
     Experiment 5 
     Alternatives to MEK and Acetone 
     A series of other alternative dielectric solvents (aside from MEK) were selected as other possible alternatives to acetone. The selected solvents had slightly higher boiling points and lower vapor pressures, and were known to dissolve or swell PVDF. The observations of Experiment 5 are provided in Table 6:

     The results reported in Table 6 suggests the lower vapor pressures of BuAc and i-PrAc result in less evaporation during spinning than MEK and as a result there is less viscosity change culminating in smaller diameter fibers. The lower dielectric constants of BuAc and i-PrAc likely limit the fiber production rate. 
     Experiment 6 
     Surfactants 
     In Experiment 6, a surfactant was added to the composition to determine if the beads on the fiber could be eliminated or at least reduced by reducing the surface tension of the mixture. 
     It was also theorized that the addition of a surfactant might assist in stabilizing the dispersion of BaTiO 3 , which might improve the fiber spinning properties. Two tests were conducted, 6a and 6b. 
     In the first test 6a, DMSO and acetone were combined as the solvent, and BDP-MB-1 produced by BDP Innovative Chemicals Inc. (Orlando, Fla., USA) was used with water as a surfactant. 
     In the second test 6b, DMSO, MEK, and BuAc were combined as the solvent, and BaTiO 3  was added, with Zephrym PD 2234-NV-LQ-(AP) (Zpm) (Croda International Plc, East Yorkshire, UK) as a surfactant. The observations are shown in Table 7:

     It was noted that bead formation appeared to be eliminated in test 6a, perhaps due to a decrease in surface tension. The fiber output was qualitatively low in comparison to the acetone formulation without BDP. In addition, the conductivity of the mixture is increased when adding ionic surfactants, which may cause a loss of dielectrophoretic forces. 
     Experiment 7 
     Polyglycercol-3 Investigation 
     Polyglycerol-3 (PG-3) was introduced since it has a relatively high dielectric constant (∈ r ≈30). A mixture with 5% PG-3 as shown in Table 8, produced fibers. The fiber output was quite high, comparable to the corresponding formulation without PG-3. However the fiber diameter increased significantly.

Additional Discussion
 
     Based on the experiments conducted, several conclusions may be drawn. 
     It would appear a high dielectric polymer (K2850-04) dissolved in a high dielectric solvent (DMSO) does show promise in improving the production rates of small particles. 
     The addition of a high dielectric constant additive (e.g., ceramic 
     BaTiO 3  nanoparticles) also appears to have positive effects on fiber output and production rates. 
     Adding a solvent with an intermediate dielectric constant (e.g., acetone) between the dielectric constants of the polymer (K2850-04) and main solvent (DMSO) may improve fiber output, but at the expense of fiber diameter. 
     It is believed that various other high dielectric additives could be suitable for improving particle production rates or decreasing particle sizes, or both. Examples of other dielectric materials that might be suitable as additives are listed in Table 10:

     It is also believed that various other polymers may have sufficiently high dielectric constants so as to be optimally suitable for the compositions and methods described herein. For example, polyurethane (∈ r ≈6.30), phenolic (∈ r ≈6.50-17.50), and Kynar (PVDF) (∈ r ≈8.4), and Tedlar® PVF film, made by DuPont have high dielectric constants and may be suitable. In addition, vinylidene fluoride co- and ter-polymers have a very high dielectric constant (∈ r ≈10-70). 
     Lower dielectric polymers can also be formulated to achieve similar results. However, as the polarity (dielectric constant) of the solvent becomes much larger than the polarity of the polymer, it is much more difficult to form a uniform mixture. In general, this limitation can be overcome by heating the mixture. This results in an expansion of the solvent compatibility by increasing the entropy of the system. 
     As described herein below, this approach can be taken to its logical extreme, with considerable success, by heating the mixture to a temperature approaching or even exceeding the melting point of the polymer. Under these conditions, even a polymer with a low dielectric constant can be dispersed into a high dielectric constant solvent to achieve a low viscosity and uniform mixture. In this case, the quantity of solvent can be reduced and the solvent&#39;s incompatibility with the polymer can be overcome. 
     In some embodiments, the high dielectric polymer could have a dielectric constant above 2, a dielectric constant above 5 and in some cases, a dielectric constant above 10. 
     In some embodiments, the high dielectric solvent could have a dielectric constant above 15, a dielectric constant above 30 or a dielectric constant above 45. 
     In some cases, the dielectric additive may have a dielectric constant above 65, above 1000 or above 100,000. 
     Material Qualification Investigations 
     Additional material qualification experiments were conducted using a nozzle-apparatus similar to the apparatus  100  as described above and as shown in  FIG. 3 . 
     Experiment 8 
     Homopolymer Vs. Co-Polymer PVDF 
     These experiments were conducted to determine how types of Poly (Vinylidene Difluoride) in the form of homopolymer (PVDF) and co-polymer (P(VDF-HFP)-Poly (Vinylidene Difluoride)-Hexafluoropropylene) would affect the physical properties of the solution and fibers produced by single nozzle spinning. Based on previous studies, a mixture of 18% Polymer, 0.3% Barium Titanate (BaTiO 3 ) as a high dielectric particle additive and two solvents (Dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) and Methyl Ethyl Ketone (MEK)) were chosen as a baseline composition to produce fiber. 
     In attempts to spin dry fiber, some formulations were prepared with polymer concentrations slightly higher or lower than 18% to modify the viscosity of the solution. In some cases, to achieve the same goal, a PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene) insert was used in the spinning set-up to reduce flow rate of the mixture. The resulting data is presented in Table 10 and Table 11 below.

     As can be seen from Table 11, all types of PVDF and (P(VDF-HFP)-based solutions were spinnable using the single nozzle set-up giving multiple powerful jets. Dripping and fine mist occurred for all investigated samples except sample 121127-JT-88-10-74 (also be referenced as sample 74, which is a reference to the last two digits of the sample code). 
     Considering the chemical structures of the different homo- and co-polymers of PVDF that were tested, the differences in the fiber size might be attributed to the branching of the polymer chain. 
     All investigated co-polymers (except Superflex 2501-20) tended to have larger fiber diameters in comparison with the homopolymer series (K711 and K705). It is believed that one ramification of the polymer chain is that this may lead to the solution having a higher viscosity, and hence some limitations with respect to how easily the mixture can be processed and the resulting fibers attenuated during dielectrophoretic spinning. As a result, the fibers tend to be larger. 
     This theory is in a good agreement with the polymer solution viscosity measurements and fiber spinning observations. Specifically, solutions prepared from the homopolymer type of PVDF (K711 and K705) were less viscous in comparison with the co-polymer solutions and gave smaller fiber diameters with better size uniformity. 
     The relationship between fiber size and viscosity of the polymer solution is noticeable from the comparison of samples with the same composition, but different homopolymer content. In particular, a higher percentage of the K705 leads to a higher viscosity the polymer solution, and results in larger fiber diameters with wider standard deviation. 
     The same trend was observed among the co-polymer P(VDF-HFP) solutions. In particular, samples were prepared from the different P(VDF-HFP) co-polymers, but using the same ratio of the formulations. The Ultraflex BCRPB(VDF-HFP) and Flex 2751-00 P(VDF-HFP) had very similar viscosities (170.93 cP and 176.30 cP, respectively), and had very similar fiber diameters: 824±193 nm and 806±353 nm, respectively. However, Superflex2501-20 P(VDF-HFP) had a lower viscosity (78.45 cP) and resulted in a smaller fiber size of only 501±233 nm. 
     Thus, PVDF in a homopolymer form may result in smaller fiber diameter due to lower viscosity of the solutions. However, in certain cases, such as when the solubility of some formulation components is an issue, the use of P(VDF-HFP) may also be beneficial. To modify the viscosity of the system and improve the morphology of the spun fibers, different additives may also be used as generally described herein. 
     Experiment 9 
     Surfactants 
     In some cases, the processability of a polymer solution may be an important characteristic, and it may be affected by different factors resulting in different fiber morphologies. In particular, fiber diameter may be a function of parameters such as flow rate, applied voltage, collecting distance, polymer structure and content, solvent properties, conductivity, viscosity, surface tension, and the properties of any fillers. 
     One of the major factors affecting the performance of polymer compositions is the surface tension of the system. The following experiments were designed to investigate the role of surfactants on the size and morphology of nanofibers. 
     The use of surfactants has arisen due to the use of different inorganic additives in polymer composites and the desire to avoid particle agglomeration and obtain even distribution of particles within a system. Surface functionalization of the additives using an appropriate surfactant or dispersant may also result in surface tension reduction (along with other effects). This reduction in surface tension may also improve particle distribution, impact electrical and rheological properties, and as a result may improve or discourage the spinnability of the composition. It is also believed that surfactants can be used to reduce fiber diameter by reducing the surface tension of the polymer in the solution. Surface tension is the primary force resisting the attenuation of the fluid. It is usually assumed that the smallest particle size that can be achieved is one where the attenuation force is balanced by the surface tension of the fluid. 
     In this experiment, (1-dodecyl)-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (DTMAB) was incorporated in the P(VDF-HFP) solutions to study the effect of solution surface tension on the fiber diameter. The resulting data is presented below in Table 12.

     The sample 120814-AK-80-36-22A (sample 22a) was prepared from K2850-04 P(VDF-HFP) (18%) and DMSO and MEK with no additives. The resulting fiber diameters were 597 nm±200 nm. 
     With a 0.5% DTMAB doping level (sample 68, 121122-TL-77-89-68) fiber diameter was reduced to 356±47 nm. The addition of the DTMAB surfactant appears to have decreased surface tension and viscosity (slightly), while resulting in a decrease in the fiber diameter. 
     Other factors (beyond surface tension and viscosity) may also play a role in reducing the fiber diameter when using this surfactant. For example, the presence of the surfactant within the air-fluid interface may reduce the solvent evaporation rate, thus extending jet stretching and allowing more time for fiber attenuation. 
     It is also notable that variance in the size of the fiber was improved. In particular, adding the DTMAB reduced the standard deviation from 200 nm to 47 nm. 
     Subsequently, additional experiments (samples 28, 70 and 71b) were performed to evaluate the effect of adding barium titanate (BaTiO 3 ) particles as a high dielectric additive on the fiber morphology. 
     To evaluate the effect of BaTiO 3  particles, samples 28 and 22A can be compared. As can be observed, there was no improvement in the fiber size when BaTiO 3  particles were added (and in fact, fiber diameter increased from 597±200 nm to 720±256 nm in the presence of BaTiO 3 ). 
     It is possible that the increase in the fiber size might be related to agglomeration of nanoparticles in this system. It was postulated that particle aggregation might be prevented by using a suitable surfactant to decrease surface free energy of the system and improve dispersion of the filler in the matrix. To evaluate this theory, BaTiO 3  particles were incorporated in the system in the presence of DTMAB (samples 70 and 71b). 
     The samples 70 and 71b have the same composition: 18% K2850-04 P(VDF-HFP)+0.5% DTMAB+0.3% BaTiO 3 +32.48% DMSO+48.72% MEK, and the difference between these samples was how they were prepared. In particular, two different techniques for DTMAB incorporation were chosen to allow the surfactant to first adsorb either on the surface of BaTiO 3  particles (sample 70) or be first dissolved in the presence of the polymer (sample 71b). 
     For sample 70, the DMSO was split into 2 portions, one used to disperse BaTiO 3  and the second to dissolve DTMAB. In particular, the barium titanate was mixed with the DMSO and then sonicated for 35 min for better particle distribution within the solvent. The DTMAB was easily dissolved in the DMSO. These two compositions were then mixed together and stirred for 1 h at 70° C. It is believed that under this condition, DTMAB adsorption on the surface of BaTiO 3  will take place. In the meantime, P(VDF-HFP) pellets were mixed with MEK and stirred in an oil-bath at 70° C. Once the (BaTiO 3 +DTMAB) solution was ready, the P(VDF-HFP) was almost fully dissolved in the MEK; the two solutions were then mixed together and stirred at 70° C. until homogenous. 
     For sample 71b, the DTMAB was mixed with MEK first, then heated at 70° C. to dissolve. Then, P(VDF-HFP) pellets were added while continuing stirring at 70° C. in the oil-bath until all P(VDF-HFP) was dissolved (which took approximately 1 h 20 min). In the meantime, BaTiO 3  powder was sonicated in DMSO for approximately 1 hour to get good distribution of particles in the solvent. These mixtures were then combined and stirred until homogenous, which took about 10 minutes. 
     As can be observed in Table 12, the presence of the BaTiO 3  and DTMAB together considerably reduced fiber diameter from 597 nm (sample 22A) to 285 nm (sample 70) and 222 nm (sample 71b). As such, it appears that the incorporation of BaTiO 3  particles had a positive influence on the fiber diameter reduction, which suggest that high dielectric BaTiO 3  may significantly improve dielectrophoretic spinning when used in the presence of surfactant. 
     In the case of sample 71b, the reduction in fiber size was somewhat stronger. This suggests that surfactant dispersion first with the polymer may play a useful role. 
     It is evident that the addition of the DTMAB surfactant reduced fiber size under all conditions. For example, for sample 22A (no surfactant, no BaTiO 3 ) and sample 68 (no BaTiO 3 , but with surfactant), the fiber diameter dropped down from 597±200 nm to 356±47 nm. In light of the chemical structure of DTMAB, this drop may also be related to the changes of the crystallinity and morphology of the P(VDF-HFP) in the presence of surfactant. 
     In particular, P(VDF-HFP) as a copolymer is a semi-crystalline matrix, where the PVDF crystallizes partially. The crystalline phase appears mostly as a non-polar phase which will not interact (or is less reactive) with the solvent (in particular, the polarity indices of the DMSO and MEK are 7.2 and 4.7 respectively, as compared with the polarity index of water=10.2). 
     In the presence of DTMAB, the non-polar/crystalline phase may be greatly decreased in the P(VDF-HFP). This may make polymer-solvents interaction more attractive. As a result, different properties of the polymer (such as flexibility and elongation), as well as solvent evaporation during spinning may be improved. This appears to be supported by the collected data. 
     As for BaTiO 3  in sample 71b, having a more polar polymer surface should enhance the interaction of the polar BaTiO 3  particles with the polymer, which should enhance particle distribution within the mixture. 
     It should also be noted that pre-treatment of the BaTiO 3  with the surfactant did not seem to result in a better dispersion of the particles in the solution as was assumed (see sample 70), and particle agglomeration still took place. This might relate to incomplete disintegration of the initial BaTiO 3  powder before DTMAB adsorption. Considering the structure of DTMAB, adsorption of DTMAB on the surface of BaTiO 3  particles will expose non-polar “tails” of the DTMAB into the media. This may reduce the interaction and agglomeration of the particles. As a result, having agglomerates in the final mixture might relate to the treatment of the initial aggregates, but not single particles. 
     Other reasons for the formation of agglomerates in the system could relate to insufficient quantities of the surfactant to achieve adequate dispersion, or insufficiently strong coupling of the DTMAB with the BaTiO 3  surface. This might leave particles in the solution without any protection. Considering the small particle sizes involved (on the nanometer scale), such particles may be likely to experience agglomeration due to their high surface free energy. 
     In summary, the presence of high dielectric BaTiO 3  particles in the system and a modified polymer surface (using a surfactant) appears to result in a desired reduction on the fiber diameter. 
     Experiment 10 
     Ultra High Dielectric Constant Particles 
     In an attempt to confirm the effect of high dielectric constant additives on fiber diameter, a set of experiments using LSNO (La 1.6 Sr 0.4 NiO 4 ) nanoparticles (with a dielectric constant □˜100,000) instead of BaTiO 3  (□˜1,700) was performed. 
     The data obtained (Table 13 and Table 14 below) showed that replacement of BaTiO 3  (sample 18A) with the LSNO (sample 44c) in the same system considerably reduced the fiber size (from 717 nm±248 nm to 312 nm±73 nm) even without any surfactant in the mixture. Moreover, the flowability of the solution with the LSNO (sample 44c) was much higher in comparison with the mixtures with BaTiO 3  (sample 18A) and there is a complete elimination of particles and beads in the product fiber (sample 22B). In order to confirm that observed fiber diameter reduction relates to both the dielectric constant of the additive and its reduced impact on the viscosity of the system, the content of P(VDF-HFP) in the solution was varied while keeping the same ratio for the LSNO and solvents (see Table 14).

     The results presented in Table 14 showed that increasing the polymer content from 18% to 20% and 24% led to a higher viscosity of the solutions. At the same time, fiber size increased considerably: from 312±73 to 926±186 nm. This suggests that viscosity of the solution is likely one of the main factors that contributed to the reduction in fiber diameter and variability. 
     Considering that LSNO has an enormously high dielectric constant in comparison with that of other components of the mixture, further studies of the effects of LSNO in the presence of BaTiO 3  were performed to make a “dielectric ladder” of the system more uniform. 
     Two different approaches were used to study synergetic effect of the LSNO and BaTiO 3  on the fiber diameter: either keeping 0.3% of each in the mixture (sample 52), or splitting a total 0.3% of high dielectric additive content equally between LSNO and BaTiO 3  (sample 53). For both scenarios two different set-ups were used to collect fibers, at 9 cm and 16 cm tip to collector distance. Results are presented in Table 15:

     The data suggests that fiber diameter in the presence of both the LSNO and BaTiO 3  is similar or less than for the compositions with only BaTiO 3  as a high dielectric additive, but is much higher than for the composition with only high dielectric LSNO. In particular, substitution of the LSNO with the BaTiO 3  (sample 53) led to the fiber diameter increasing. The presence of the BaTiO 3  in the system with the LSNO in the same amount (sample 52) also resulted in the fiber size increasing. As such, no evident synergetic effect of two dry powder high dielectric additives was observed. 
     Experiment 11 
     Increasing the BaTiO 3  Content 
     A study to vary BaTiO 3  concentration was conducted to determine if an increased amount of the high dielectric material would decrease the fiber diameter and or increase the fiber output (Table 16 below). Prior to conducting the BaTiO 3  concentration study, it was decided that K705 PVDF powder was the desired option out of the PVDF and P(VDF-HFP) samples tested therefore the concentration study was carried out using K705 (see Table 11). 
     In general, the formulations were prepared by sonicating BaTiO 3  in DMSO for 1 h. With the increased amount of BaTiO 3 , the DMSO/BaTiO 3  solution became thicker. With the belief that it would be difficult to transfer the BaTiO 3 /DMSO solution, PVDF and MEK were added to the BaTiO 3 /DMSO mixture. The mixture was stirred and heated in a water bath of ˜60° C. 
     Despite the use of the water bath (as opposed to just placing the vial on the hotplate surface as had been done for previous formulation preparations), there were still solids stuck to the top sides of the jar rendering it impossible to obtain a uniformly mixed solution. Furthermore, despite using the same technique to prepare all three formulations, the solution with 3% BaTiO 3  seemed more difficult to mix well and to disperse the BaTiO 3  therein, as compared to the 1% and 4% BaTiO 3 , which was unexpected. 
     Overall, it was difficult to mix the formulations, which rendered the concentration of the solution to be spun imprecise. Nevertheless, the solutions were spun in order to ascertain a general idea of the phenomenon which occurs with higher and higher amounts of BaTiO 3 , even if the solutions were not exactly 1, 3 and 4% BaTiO 3 .

     The formulation with 1% BaTiO 3  (sample 47) spun fairly well. There was a good lay down and no major dripping. The fiber deposition seemed similar to the 0.3% BaTiO 3  (sample 43). 
     There was a little bit more dripping when the 3% BaTiO 3  formulation (sample 49) was spun. After the experiment, it was noted that the fiber looked bumpy and chunky and it was hypothesized that perhaps there were large agglomerates of BaTiO 3  still present as a result of the trouble mixing the solution. Furthermore, at the end of the spinning experiment it was observed that the tip of the nozzle was clogged and that the solution in the pipette and in the vial had started to precipitate or separate. Approximately 5-10 min after the spinning experiment the solution had formed a gel. Therefore it is possible that the chunky bumps were globs of separated PVDF. 
     On the other hand, the 4% BaTiO 3  formulation (sample 50) spun well and there was very little dripping. 
     SEM image analysis of these samples indicated that the 1% BaTiO 3  formulation was well dispersed whereas the 3% BaTiO 3  mixture had some agglomeration of particles and 4% BaTiO 3  was fairly well dispersed. It appears as though the difficulty in mixing the 3% BaTiO 3  sample did affect the dispersion of the BaTiO 3  particles. 
     On the other hand, in the samples with good dispersion of BaTiO 3  (e.g. 1% in sample 47 and 4% in sample 50), fiber diameter had increased by about 200 nm from the baseline 0.3% BaTiO 3  formulation. 
     The average fiber diameter for both the 3% BaTiO 3  remained essentially unchanged at 420 nm. It is possible that since the particles agglomerated, the potential enhanced effect was diminished and the material responded as a solution with little to no BaTiO 3  present. Overall, it appears that as the particles are better dispersed, the fiber diameter increases. 
     Upon examination of the fiber output results, concerns were raised regarding the reliability and accuracy of the fiber output data and the single nozzle experiment setup. The fiber output was high with 1% BaTiO 3 , greater than the 0.3% BaTiO 3 , but then dropped significantly for the 3% BaTiO 3  and then increased again back up for the 4% BaTiO3 formulation. These results did not follow the expected trend of increasing fiber output with increasing BaTiO 3  content, and suggest that there may have been experimental problems. 
     Based on the difficulty mixing the higher concentration BaTiO 3  mixture and the subsequent inconsistent results obtained, the 3% and 4% BaTiO 3  solutions were prepared and evaluated again. 
     A slightly different preparation method was used and the solutions were spun to determine if a better-mixed solution would produce more consistent results. This other approach involved adding the DMSO/BaTiO 3  mixture to a mixture of MEK/PVDF since in previous preparations of other formulations less material ended up adhering to the top sides of the jar. 
     The DMSO and BaTiO 3  solution was sonicated for 1 h while a mixture of the PVDF and MEK was stirred and heated on a hotplate set to 75° C. It was difficult to transfer the entire mixture since the thick solutions left a film of material on the sides of the vial. Upon transferring the BaTiO 3  solution to the PVDF mixture, some MEK would reflux in the capped jar which was heated to 75° C. During the reflux process, the MEK would carry some BaTiO 3  to the top sides of the jar and once deposited on the walls, the BaTiO 3  was difficult to remix into the solution. The high concentration BaTiO 3  mixtures remain difficult to prepare and unfortunately, the second preparation method did not improve the homogeneity nor improve the precision of the solution composition. Nevertheless, the samples were spun and the results are presented here:

     The fiber spinning observations for the repeated formulations were different than the first batch of samples. The second 3% BaTiO 3  solution (121025-TL-77-56-49a) dripped a lot more than the previous 3% BaTiO 3  sample (121016-TL-77-49-49). A section of PTFE tubing was inserted into the pipette tip to restrict the solution flow rate, which reduced the dripping resulting in dry fiber. Given that dry fiber was produced this time, a fiber output measurement was carried out. However, after waiting 24 h to weigh the fiber, the combined fiber and paper weighed less than the paper before the fiber was deposited on it, which is not possible and indicates again experimental error. Therefore, no fiber output result is reported. 
     The fiber spinning process for the 4% BaTiO 3  solution (121025-TL-77-57-50) was similar to the previously spun 4% BaTiO 3  solution (121016-TL-77-50-50), although, the fiber output was significantly lower (1.74 g/min) than the first sample (7.95 g/min). 
     SEM images of the 3% samples again showed mostly agglomerated particles. However, SEM images for the 4% samples were very different. In particular, the particles were well dispersed in the first 4% sample and were agglomerated in the second 4% sample. 
     Since the spinning process and fiber quality was not reproducible for the 3% BaTiO 3  solution and the fiber output and particle dispersion were not repeatable for the 4% BaTiO 3  mixture, this raises concerns about managing a system with a high concentration of BaTiO 3  particles and the overall general acceptability of all single nozzle results. 
     In order to evaluate the potential advantages and disadvantages of increased BaTiO 3  concentrations, it was determined that a dispersant should be used. The hope was that the dispersant would improve the dispersion and stability of the mixture, which would lead to more reproducible fiber results. Furthermore, the fiber output was considered not to be an accurate measurement to carry out without a controlled solution flow rate and a larger fiber sample mass, and therefore no further fiber output measurements were carried out on the single nozzle experiment setup. The fiber output data from the single nozzle was also not really necessary to determine whether a solution was appropriate to scale up and try on the disk spinning apparatus. 
     Experiment 12 
     Dispersion of BaTiO 3  Using a Dispersant 
     In the single nozzle experiments, the fiber diameter for the baseline formulation without BaTiO 3  (sample 22) was lower by about 200 nm in comparison to the formulation with BaTiO 3 , (sample 18). However, the fiber output and quality improved with BaTiO 3  incorporated in the formulation, rendering sample 18 superior over sample 22. Hence, sample 18 was used as the new baseline formulation. 
     Preliminary experiments using a disk apparatus (i.e. the apparatus of  FIG. 1 ) demonstrated that the presence of BaTiO 3  in the baseline formulation (sample 28) had little to no effect on the fiber diameter in comparison with the baseline formulation without BaTiO 3  (sample b). 
     For the disk setup, in contrast to the nozzle experiment setup, the fiber production rate is predominantly controlled by the applied air pressure used to adjust the flow of solution. The presence of the high dielectric particles under these conditions does not have the opportunity to change the fiber output as in the single nozzle experiments. 
     An experiment was therefore conducted to determine if an increased amount of BaTiO 3  was required in order to observe an effect such as reduced fiber diameter or any other form of improvement with the disk apparatus. The previous study examining an increased amount of BaTiO 3  did not show any evidence of decreasing fiber diameter. However, this may have been because there was insufficient dispersion of the BaTiO 3  particles. It is believed that in order to increase the effective dielectric constant of a material, the high dielectric particle additives must be well dispersed therein. 
     Possible dispersants that may be useful for dispersing BaTiO 3  include phosphonic acids, particularly those that are tailored to be more compatible with the host polymer (for example, a fluorous phosphonic acid could be especially suitable for dispersing BaTiO 3  nanoparticles in P(VDF-HFP)). Other dispersant options are Dupont Zonyl UR fluorophosphonic acid, but this and structurally similar alternatives are no longer available from Dupont. 
     Alternatively, other dispersants may include alkyltrimethoxysilanes. Both alkyl and perfluorinated alkyltrimethoxysilanes were available for this study. The nonafluorohexyltrimethoxysilane (F9TMS) was initially tried (see Table 18). 
     One approach for using a dispersant involves a pre-treatment method where the BaTiO 3  particles were reacted with an excess of the dispersant, then isolated, washed and dried before dispersing them in P(VDF-HFP). However, a simpler approach was selected for this study to conduct a proof of principle experiment to determine if there was any indication of an improvement in the dispersion of BaTiO 3  within PVDF. 
     It was assumed that the entire surface of the BaTiO 3  particle was covered with hydroxyl groups and the corresponding amount of F9TMS required to react in a 1:1 ratio with the hydroxyl groups was calculated. Methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) was added to BaTiO 3  and the mixture was sonicated for 25 min to pre-disperse the particles in the solvent. The dispersant, F9TMS was then dissolved in MEK and then added to the BaTiO 3  solution. The combined mixture was then heated and stirred at 80° C. for 1 h. The P(VDF-HFP) and DMSO were then added and stirred, and heated at 80° C. for 20 min until all P(VDF-HFP) was dissolved. 
     Two different concentrations of BaTiO 3  were examined, 1% and 4% BaTiO 3 . Some unusual observations were noted during the nozzle spinning experiment, which suggested that the F9TMS was having at least some sort of effect on the spinning process. These observations included poor fiber lay down and lots of standup fiber. A slightly better lay down of fiber was possible only if craft paper alone was used as a substrate for fiber deposition (as opposed to mylar with craft paper on top). SEM images of the resulting fibers showed inconsistent results. In the 1% BaTiO 3  formulation (sample 59), the F9TMS seems to have caused the particles to agglomerate, and as such the BaTiO 3  particles were better dispersed without any dispersant added. 
     On the other hand, the SEM images of the 4% formulation with F9TMS (sample 61), demonstrated that the particles were much better dispersed if compared to 121025-TL-77-57-50, but about the same as 121016-TL-77-50-50. In comparing the 4% BaTiO3 solution which was poorly dispersed and 401 nm average diameter fiber without the dispersant (1210-25-TL-77-57-50), to well dispersed and 814 nm average fiber diameter with F9TMS (61), the data follows the dispersion/fiber diameter trend.

     Experiment 13 
     Incorporating a Liquid High Dielectric Constant Additive 
     Propylene carbonate (PC) was selected to determine if a high dielectric liquid would be beneficial (perhaps more beneficial than solid super high dielectric nanoparticles) for producing small nanofibers at a high rate. 
     Propylene carbonate has a dielectric constant (∈) of 66, which is higher than DMSO, which previously was the highest dielectric constant (∈=47) solvent in the formulation. 
     PVDF K705 was selected as the starting polymer. Three different types of solutions based on the baseline formulation (sample 43) were then prepared, one where DMSO is completely replaced by PC (sample 62), a second one where the DMSO is halved and an equivalent of PC is added (sample 63), and finally a third mixture with both DMSO and PC, but no BaTiO 3  (sample 64) (Table 3.9.1). 
     The standard procedure for preparing the baseline formulation was employed and the PC was initially added to the DMSO/BaTiO 3  solution before sonicating. In the case where there was no DMSO in the formulation, the BaTiO 3  was sonicated in PC. 
     For sample 62 with no DMSO, it took considerably longer to dissolve the PVDF. The solution had to stir in a 70° C. oil bath overnight to dissolve the PVDF. It was also observed that the solution only remained homogenous when heated, and the solution precipitated as it cooled to room temperature and formed a gel. Therefore, it was not possible to perform viscosity and conductivity measurements or a spinning experiment with this sample. 
     The mixture with DMSO and PC (sample 63) dissolved more quickly (1 h25 min) than sample 62, although the baseline formulation can dissolve in &lt;1 h, therefore PC does seem to be hindering the dissolution of the PVDF. 
     Sample 63 remained in the liquid state long enough to carry out the viscosity measurement (at 60° C.), and the spinning experiment (at room temperature), but then started to crystallize while preparing for a conductivity measurement. 
     The solution without BaTiO 3  (sample 64), was prepared by adding all the components together and then heating and stirring in the 70° C. oil bath. The PVDF dissolved readily and the mixture was well mixed and completely dissolved in &lt;40 min. The solution remained in the liquid state for the viscosity and the spinning experiment but then turned cloudy and started to gel, therefore no conductivity measurement was performed. 
     For those samples that were spinnable the fiber diameter was comparable to the K705 baseline formulation in the 400 nm range. The PC does not seem to have a positive impact on the K705 formulation, but the potential for any constructive contribution to fiber production is hindered by the tendency of K705 to precipitate. The initial study with K705 provided some insight on incorporating PC into the formulation. However, it was evident that the PVDF crystallized easily making the solution difficult to handle at room temperature, which may be undesirable. 
     For the next set of experiments, the copolymer P(VDF-HFP) K2850-04, was used instead because it was known to be more soluble and less likely to crystallize at room temperature. Comparable formulations with K2850-04 with only PC and MEK (40:60) (sample 66) and PC/DMSO/MEK (20:20:60) (sample 65) were prepared using the same procedure followed for the K705 formulations. 
     The K2850-04 was definitely more easily dissolved in the presence of PC and MEK (sample 66) given that the mixture was well mixed and all dissolved in 2 h, in comparison to the corresponding K705 formulation which had to be stirred and heated overnight. However, this formulation did gel during the fiber spinning experiment. Sample 65 dissolved in 1.5 h and was the first mixture containing PC to remain liquid for the viscosity measurement, spinning experiment and the conductivity measurement.

     The viscosity for sample 65 was 65.68 cP, which is approximately the same as the baseline solution without PC (sample 28). Therefore, incorporating PC into the formulation at a ratio of 20:20:60 PC/DMSO/MEK does not seem to have a significant effect on the solution viscosity. 
     However, despite the similar solution viscosity, the fiber diameter is considerably lower for sample 65, suggesting that PC does have a positive effect on fiber diameter. The fiber diameter dropped from 720 nm to 145 nm for sample 65. 
     The conductivity measurement indicated a solution conductivity of 11.6 μS/cm for sample 65, which was only slightly higher than the baseline formulation (9.8 μS/cm) suggesting that PC does not have a significant effect on the solution conductivity. 
     In the BaTiO 3  concentration studies, it was hypothesized that the viscosity might play a more dominant role in dictating the fiber diameter than high dielectric BaTiO 3  particles, even with higher concentrations of BaTiO 3 . The PC study seems to display a different outcome. The viscosity of the PC formulation (sample 65) was comparable to the baseline formulation (sample 28) yet the fiber diameter was drastically lower, which may suggest that the higher dielectric constant of PC, a liquid high dielectric additive, is capable of having a more noteworthy impact on reducing fiber diameter than a high dielectric solid particle. 
     In other words, if PC is present, then an ultra-low viscosity may not be required to obtain an ultra-low fiber diameter. Furthermore, PC may be more beneficial over BaTiO 3  since it does not increase the viscosity and therefore reduces the amount of obstacles to produce small nanofiber. 
     One more formulation containing PC was prepared to determine if the amount of PC could be reduced in order to improve the solubility of K2850-04 further and still have enough PC present to reduce fiber diameter. 
     The solvent ratio was adjusted to 10:40:50 PC/DMSO/MEK in sample 67. The intent was to maintain the DMSO content the same as the baseline, add a small amount of PC and adjust the MEK accordingly. Previous studies indicated that an MEK concentration of 40-60% all displayed similar results, therefore a slight adjustment to the MEK content was considered sufficient to accommodate PC in the formulation. 
     Sample 67 was scaled up from the standard 50 g used to prepare other PC formulations to 60 g and as a result, the vial used to sonicate the BaTiO 3  solution was not of sufficient volume to contain both DMSO and PC as was previously carried out. Therefore the PC was added to the MEK/P(VDF-HFP) mixture instead. 
     Surprisingly, the combination of PC and MEK seemed to dissolve the P(VDF-HFP) faster than just MEK alone. The P(VDF-HFP) dissolved in just PC and MEK while stirring in the 70° C. oil bath in only 45 min. This was unusual because normally, after stirring MEK/P(VDF-HFP) at 70° C. for 45 min, polymer pellets still remain. It was convenient that PC assisted in dissolving P(VDF-HFP) faster, but it was surprising considering in previous P(VDF-HFP) experiments when the DMSO/PC/BaTiO 3  solution was added to the MEK/P(VDF-HFP) mixture, it took longer to dissolve than when preparing the baseline mixture (sample 28). 
     In addition, PC seemed to cause the P(VDF-HFP) to crystallize and gel in sample 66. Sample 67 is thus a good example of how the order of addition of solution components can affect sample preparation. Moreover, sample 67 was stable at room temperature and the viscosity, conductivity and fiber data were collected. 
     The viscosity of the sample 67 was slightly higher (78.19 cP) than the baseline formulation, which likely explains why there was no spray or dripping during the spinning experiment. This formulation may be slightly more viscous considering there is less MEK present since MEK is the least viscous solvent in the mixture. Perhaps the increased viscosity produced somewhat larger fibers. Sample 67 further supports the theory that the PC plays a role in reducing the fiber diameter and it appears that as the PC concentration decreases, less of a positive effect is observed. 
     Sample 65 produced the smallest diameter fibers out of all of the solutions studied using the single nozzle spinning experiment setup. The next best formulation was the LSNO sample 44 which produced fiber with an average diameter of 312 nm. The LSNO nanoparticles have an ultra-high dielectric constant (∈˜100,000), greater than BaTiO 3  (∈˜1,700), which may explain why the fiber diameter was less for LSNO than for the baseline formulation. 
     Propylene carbonate (PC) displayed a very significant decrease in fiber diameter. However, 16.34 overall weight percent of PC was required to achieve this effect, whereas only 0.3% LSNO was required to decrease the fiber diameter. 
     It is possible that a greater concentration of LSNO may reduce the fiber diameter down to 145 nm or less, although a greater concentration of LSNO may also increase the solution viscosity resulting in a larger fiber diameter. LSNO nanoparticles are also quite expensive, thus PC may be more practical alternative even if 16% is required. In conclusion, a liquid high dielectric agent may be more effective than a nano-size solid high dielectric agent, simply because it will disperse more effectively. Extremely high dielectric properties cannot be used to produce small fibers at high rates if the small particles are not dispersed properly. Hence, a liquid with a high, but not exceedingly high dielectric constant, can outperform a particulate agent of enormously high dielectric agent in the right circumstances. 
     Discussion of Material Qualification Investigations 
     In general, the material qualification investigations focused on the following constituents: 
     Polymer and active solvent; 
     Low vapor pressure latent solvent with highest possible dielectric constant for smallest fiber size and highest volume of production while suppressing premature evaporation during fiber formation; 
     Additives with varying magnitudes of dielectric constant for promoting fiber attenuation via a dielectrophoretic force; 
     A surfactant to aid dispersion of dielectric additives, reduce surface tension, and/or modify the polymer-solvent interaction; and 
     Conductive additives to increase the conductivity of the solution; 
     As opposed to conventional electrospinning, which utilizes Coulomb and electric forces to drive fiber attenuation, the motivation here was to design materials incorporating dielectric additives to drive fiber attenuation via dielectrophoretic forces. Two distinct classifications of material architectures that incorporate dielectric additives can be considered. 
     The first is a “D2-additive package”, which includes material, generally a solid nanoparticle (&lt;50 nm), having very high dielectric constant, such as BaTiO 3  (∈&gt;1000) or LSNO nanoparticles (∈&gt;100,000). 
     The second is a “D1-additive package”, which includes a material, generally liquid, having a moderately high dielectric constant such as PC (∈˜60). 
     In some embodiments, D1 and D2 additive packages may be combined (e.g., moderate dielectric liquid stacked with a high dielectric nanoparticle) so as to provide improved performance (i.e. smaller particle sizes). 
     In general, the various solvents and dielectric additives may be selected in such a manner as to create a “dielectric ladder”, where each additional additive has a higher dielectric constant that the preceding additive. For instance, the components of the following mixture are listed in the order of increasing dielectric constant: [P(VDF-HFP)/MEK/DMSO/PC/BaTiO 3 ]. 
     For the scope of this study, material architectures using a D2-additive package primarily focused on using polarizable ceramic nanoparticles (such as BaTiO 3 ) in a material arrangement such as [P(VDF-HFP)/MEK/DMSO/BaTiO 3 ], referred to as the baseline BaTiO 3  mixture. The most significant insights appear to be the following: 
     As more BaTiO 3  is added, the solutions viscosity increases. 
     Well dispersed BaTiO 3  results in decreased fiber diameter. 
     Experiments conducted with higher concentrations of BaTiO 3  were generally not repeatable as dispersion of these particles becomes progressively more difficult. 
     Solution viscosity is one of the governing properties that strongly dictates fiber diameter. One can consider the simple kinetics argument that at high viscosity, the attenuation of the fiber becomes slower and in the short timeframe of the process, the smallest theoretically possible fiber size cannot actually be attained. Hence, even a very good dielectric mixture simply cannot get fiber size small enough at the required speed before the fiber has ejected the solvent and become a solid if the viscosity of the mixture is high. 
     For subsequent studies, a D1-additive package was incorporated with the BaTiO 3  baseline mixture (i.e., D2-additive package), resulting in mixtures of the form [P(VDF-HFP)/MEK/DMSO/PC/BaTiO 3 ], referred to as the Propylene Carbonate (PC) baseline mixture. The findings from studies using the PC baseline mixture are as follows: 
     In the presence of PC (a liquid, higher dielectric constant additive) the viscosity of the solution [P(VDF-HFP)/MEK/DMSO/PC] remained constant, but the fiber diameter decreased by 5×(720 nm to 145 nm). 
     A high dielectric constant solvent D1-additive package (e.g., PC) produces a homogeneous solution, which may be more advantageous for promoting fiber attenuation than using a higher-dielectric nanoparticle D2-additive package (e.g., BaTiO 3 ), which produces a heterogeneous solution. 
     Material studies so far show that solutions with BaTiO 3  may have a limited to negligible effect on fiber attenuation. On the other hand, solutions with a higher dielectric LNSO nanoparticle [P(VDF-HFP)/DMSO/MEK/LSNO], referred to as the baseline LSNO mixture, were able to reduce the fiber diameter, but only by 2.5×. It is believed that this is entirely the result of the dispersion of these materials and not as a result of their relative dielectric properties. 
     In addition, studies were conducted with different types of PVDF polymer, namely PVDF in the form of a co-polymer P(VDF-HFP) (e.g., K2850-04) and homopolymer PVDF (K705). From these studies, it was observed that: 
     PVDF in the form of the homopolymer (e.g., PVDF K705) may be more useful for producing fibers of the smallest diameter due to the lower viscosity of the solutions in comparison with the co-polymer. Considering the chemical structure of the homo- and co-polymers of PVDF, the difference in the fiber size might be attributed to the branching of the polymer chain. In certain cases, when the solubility of the formulation components is an issue, the P(VDF-HFP) co-polymer may be more beneficial.
 
Mass Production Optimization Experiments
 
     Mass production optimization experiments were conducted using an apparatus similar to the apparatus  10  as described above and as shown in  FIG. 1 . In general, a polymer solution was deposited into a reservoir (i.e. a syringe) coupled to the feed chamber or dispenser  16 . 
     Under the application of applied air pressure (solution pressure, Δp), the polymer solution is pumped through PTFE tubing from the reservoir to the fiber spinning apparatus. 
     A production rate Q was obtained by measuring the volume of polymer solution that passes from the reservoir within a given interval of time. Fiber production is the polymer solids content of the mixture (as a fractional weight) times this value of Q. 
     As generally described above with respect to  FIGS. 1 and 2 , the polymer solution is deposited at (or near) the axis of rotation of the disk surface  14  that is rotating with a speed w. The mixture then flowed outwardly under the influence of centripetal forces, eventually separating from the edge of the disk to form particles. 
     In the presence of the electrostatic field gradient existing near the surface of the disk and surrounding the individual prefibers emerging from the edge of the disk, the particles tend to further attenuate. Any residual solvent is ejected and/or evaporates during this process, and the remaining polymer particles (fibers) are deposited on the collector plate if one is arranged to be nearby. 
     Two methods for collecting particles are discussed herein: (i) stationary collection and (ii) continuous collection. During stationary collection, a substrate remained stationary on top of the collector plate and fibers accumulate thereon. On the other hand, for experiments conducted with continuous collection, the substrate was transported in a continuous manner and allowed to slide along the surface of the collector plate (which is usually some form of metal grid, mesh, foil, sheet, plate). 
     Starting from a location directly underneath the central axis of the apparatus&#39; spinning rotor (r=0), the particle size generally varies in the radial direction from the inner-diameter (ID), middle (M), to the outer-diameter (OD) sampling locations. Regardless of the collection method (e.g., stationary vs. continuous), the spatial location of ID, M, and OD is similar, thus permitting direct comparison of estimated particle sizes. In general, particle size measurements were taken from the top surface of the fiber mat that formed on the substrate and were imaged via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). 
     An estimate of the strength of the electrostatic field was indirectly determined by the voltage-distance quotient, where the distance is based on DCD (disk-to-collector distance). It should be noted that all experiments were conducted using a “hot-head” configuration, where high-voltage (HV) was applied to the disk of the spinning apparatus and the collector plate was grounded. Positive voltage was applied to the spinning apparatus, generating a positive electrostatic field with field lines directed from the spinning apparatus to the collector plate. In other embodiments, other configurations for the apparatus may be possible, such as a “cold-head” configuration wherein the apparatus is grounded and the collector plate is charged. 
     It should again be noted that one of the salient features of dielectrophoretic spinning is the dependence of this phenomenon on the electric field gradient squared and not on the electric field strength as in conventional electrospinning. The grounded collector plate or counter-electrode can be entirely eliminated and the production of fibers or particles will continue. In these cases, dielectrophoretically-spun fibers will eject into the surrounding air and can be collected onto a nearby collecting surface using vacuum. This would basically be similar to the methods used to collect spun-bonded and melt-blown fibers. 
     Heat was supplied via hot air to a cowling that surrounds the spinning disk. Two high-temperature plastic supply lines were used to carry the heated air into the apparatus. The volume of air required is modest as its only function is to keep the machine and the surrounding surfaces at a target temperature. 
     In some of the experiments described herein, the polymer solution, disk, and ambient air are heated to explore the effect of heat on the production of particles. Operating at elevated temperature influences several key parameters, such as: (i) viscosity, (ii) solvent vapour pressure/evaporation, iii) solvent-polymer interactions and compatibility, iv) the dielectric constant of the various ingredients, especially high dielectric ceramic particles, v) the distance the particle or fiber can attenuate before the polymer “freezes” and becomes a solid. 
     It is believed that the viscosity of the polymer mixture and vapour pressure of solvents can be controlled or manipulated in such a manner as to encourage attenuation and form smaller particles prior to solidification of the polymer. 
     In addition, at elevated temperatures, the polymer will disperse into solvents that are normally highly incompatible with the polymer, which allows the use of solvents with much higher dielectric constants. Even polymers of low dielectric constant can be dealt with successfully at elevated temperatures. They can be dispersed in relatively high dielectric solvents directly. The combination of heat and the presence of surfactants and dispersants is synergistic and can allow enormous flexibility in formulating mixtures for spinning for virtually all polymers. 
     In some cases, the hot air injected into the cowling not only heats the spinning disk but also distributes hot air uniformly around the disk and emerges from the cowling at a velocity, Uo. This heated air helps to control the ambient temperature, To, in the zone where attenuation occurs. This heated air helps to eliminate the local ambient air temperature as a variable. For the range of velocities, Uo from 2.5 m/s to 8.0 m/s, it was found that, on the average, the fiber diameter decreases with an increase in velocity. 
     Prior to initiating each experiment, a bulk quantity of polymer solution is heated and mixed on a heated magnetic stir plate at a solution temperature Tsoln of approximately 100° C. The pre-heated solution was then transferred to the reservoir, and dielectrophoretic spinning commenced immediately thereafter. This pre-heating was found to greatly reduce fiber size and improve production rates under almost all conditions. 
     The results of these optimization experiments are discussed generally below. 
     Effect of System Heat and Cowling Velocity 
     “System Heat” is defined as a combination of pre-heating the polymer solution, applying active heat to components of the spinning apparatus (i.e., drive shaft and disk pack), and ensuring that the fibers enter a heated zone surrounding the cowling. It was observed that the addition of System Heat greatly increases both fiber production rate and reduces average fiber diameter. 
     Effect of Rotational Speed 
     The rotational speed of the fiber spinning apparatus was explored for a range of speeds from approximately 1700 rpm to 3400 rpm on a 6″ diameter disk. Generally, the fiber diameter decreases with an increase in speed, which is believed to be the result of smaller pre-fibrils generated at the disk edge under the influence of greater centripetal force on the polymer film in the disk pack. However, the change in fiber size is only gradual and modest and does not encourage the use of extraordinarily high speeds to drive fiber size downward or production rates upward. Mechanical simplicity of low-speed spinning disks is highly desirable to provide safe and reliable (i.e., long-running) equipment. 
     Effect of Fiber Deposition Thickness 
     How the thickness of a fiber web impacted quality (laydown texture, dryness, and fiber size) was explored by either forming a thick fiber deposit on a stationary substrate or forming very thin layers by casting fibers onto a moving substrate. 
     It was observed that the fiber laydown texture and dryness improve as the deposition thickness decreases. The fiber laydown texture is more uniform for thin deposits since there is less surface charge in the fiber, thereby suppressing fiber standup. In addition, uniformity of the web was very good for thin deposits as the fibers appear to search out areas of low deposition and thereby naturally create a highly uniform layer. 
     The dryness of thin webs is superior since ejected and/or evaporated solvent does not perpetually precipitate on the static sample of collected fiber. It was also observed that the fiber size did not vary or become less uniform with varying thickness of fiber deposition. 
     Effect of Temperature and Production Rate 
     The effect of temperature and production rate on fiber quality was explored for three mixtures referred to as the BaTiO 3 , LSNO, and PC baseline mixtures. It was observed that fiber diameter is generally constant over a wide range of temperature and production rate. Eventually, at exceedingly high rates of production, average fiber size increases. Elevated temperatures support the production of smaller fibers, at higher volume, and tend to result in fiber webs with improved strength. 
     It is suspected that the fiber diameter may remain constant over a wide range of production rates whenever the fibers can closely approach their limit to attenuation (where attenuation forces are eventually counter-balanced against surface tension). This should be possible whenever the viscosity of the mixture is low, which allows very rapid attenuation, and the time available to attenuate is extended by the use of solvents that are ejected or evaporate slowly. 
     However, a marked increase in production rate may increase fiber diameter because pre-fibril size eventually grows and so the amount of attenuation required eventually exceeds the capabilities of the system. Exceedingly high production rates in small poorly ventilated areas can also result in wet fiber because the solvent is ejected or evaporated, but is present in such huge quantities that it interferes with the formation of dry fiber (literally it is being filtered from the air by the fibers and being drawn to the collector). 
     To enhance dry fiber formation, a small flow of air, moving counter-current to the direction of fiber collection (i.e. the fibers are drawn down by electrostatic attraction to the collector electrode, while the counter-current air carries the solvent particles and vapor upward) can be used. When this counter-current air is gently heated, the web is of superior quality, uniformity, and strength. 
     In some cases, the LSNO baseline mixture exhibits dry fiber formation around the disk edge, referred to as bearding, and small nodes of dry fiber are found embedded in the fiber mat, referred to as tufts. As the temperature is increased for a given production rate, the fiber size in this case actually increases, which is contrary to that observed with other mixtures. 
     It is suspected this behavior occurs because an absolute attenuation limit is not being achieved. It is believed that the solvent flashes off so readily that the viscosity rises and attenuation terminates prematurely. 
     Because the solvent is not highly volatile, it is believed that the solvent is being prematurely ejected when this super-high dielectric additive is used. 
     This condition becomes worse with elevated temperature. To a degree, the dielectrophoretic forces are now so great that the solvent is being ejected before full attenuation is achieved. In fact, solvent is being ejected before the fluid can separate from the disk. 
     For LSNO, when the production rate is increased at a given temperature, the fiber diameter is actually reduced, which is also contrary to the behavior encountered with other mixtures. It is speculated that a reduction in fiber diameter with increasing flow is because the amount of solvent accumulating within the surrounding production environment is actually excessive. This actually benefits this unique system. Specifically, there is so much solvent that the fiber loses net solvent more slowly and can attenuate further before viscosity rises and causes a cessation of attenuation. 
     The effect of decreasing fiber diameter with an increase in production rate can, in fact, be observed for other mixtures, which also exhibit fiber imperfections such as bearding and tufts. Thus, these findings suggest that the excessive ejection/evaporation regime is not unique to the LSNO baseline mixture, and that other mixtures also exhibit behavior in accordance with this regime. It is rather pleasant to obtain a better product, with smaller fibers, as production rates increase, so the formation of bearding is actually a sign that production flow should be increased. 
     The difference between the LSNO and BaTiO 3  baseline mixtures is the choice of nanoparticle. However, bearding and tuft formation are restricted to the LSNO baseline mixture. It is suspected that, since the dielectric constant of LSNO (∈˜100,000) is markedly greater than BaTiO 3  (∈˜1,750), the LSNO baseline mixture experiences greater dielectric ejection and evaporation, thereby promoting more rapid solvent loss than the BaTiO 3  baseline mixture.

     In particular, the compositions listed in Table 20 and Table 21 have produced small nanofibers (&lt;350 nm) with great uniformity. The major differences of these solution mixtures as compared to the other solution mixtures include: 
     If possible, they start with a polymer such as PVDF with an elevated dielectric constant, such as a dielectric constant greater than 5. 
     They use a solvent or solvent blend whose ingredients already have a relatively high dielectric constant (greater than 15) and in some cases greater than 30; 
     They include a modest amount of a liquid (usually less than 10%) with even higher dielectric constant such as PC (∈˜60, D1-additive package); and 
     They have a material with very high dielectric constant such as BaTiO 3  or LSNO (∈&gt;1000, D2-Additive package) present in quite small amounts (generally less than 4-5% and usually less than 1%); 
     They include an additive such as DTAB (σ˜1038 μS/cm at 2% of DTAB) to help disperse the ingredients and lower surface tension. 
     Hybrid Systems 
     It has also been discovered that, in some cases, dielectrophoretic spinning may be able to generate small particles (fibers) at relatively large production rates when a mixture includes a relatively small amount of a suitable solvent (i.e. 10-75% solvent) into which a polymer has been dispersed (i.e. 25-90% by weight polymer in the mixture). 
     These systems may generally be referred to herein as “Hybrid” systems. They are a hybrid because they are not strictly a solvent dispersion and they are not strictly a molten polymer, but they are generally a dispersion of a hot or even molten polymer where the heating is sufficient to have nearly or completely overcome the polymers cohesive forces and the polymer itself is now softened or fluid at the elevated temperature of these systems. 
     In the Hybrid case, a polymer is dispersed in a relatively small volume of solvent (as compared with previously solvent-polymer mixtures that often include 80% or more of solvent). Such hybrid systems make it possible to spin nanofibers from low melt index polymers, but using equipment usually reserved for spinning polymer melts of extremely high melt flow. For example, these Hybrid systems can be directly spun using ordinary melt blowing and melt spray equipment routinely used to produce large fibers. 
     These Hybrid systems can include D1 and D2 additives, surfactants and dispersants, and the other elements of the mixtures outlined above. However, the difference is that the mixture will be heated so strongly that solvents and other ingredients that would normally not form a suitable dispersion at room temperature (or a moderate temperature) become effective at these much higher temperatures. 
     For instance, Hybrid compositions may be subjected to modest heating (i.e. at temperatures approaching the softening temperature of the polymer) to temperatures above the melting temperature of the polymer and beyond. 
     As the temperature of the mixture increases to this degree, the dispersion forces of the polymer within a given solvent greatly increase and the cohesive forces between the polymer molecules eventually collapse (i.e., the polymer melts). 
     Heating greatly increases the entropy of the system so that a polymer will disperse even into a solvent that is poorly matched by its Hansen Solubility Parameters. These parameters describe the dispersion, polar, and hydrogen bonding elements of the solvent and the polymer. Normally, a polymer will dissolve only in a solvent that closely matches its own Hansen Solubility Parameters. However, solvent and polymer compatibility expand as temperature increases and this expansion become potentially very large as one approaches and exceeds the polymer&#39;s melting point. 
     At elevated temperatures approaching or exceeding the melting point of the polymer, the solvent changes from a “solvent” to a material acting more as a “diluent” where the solvent molecules are now intercalated between mobile polymer molecules. When the heated polymer is mixed with a solvent that is poorly matched in Hansen Solubility Parameters, the polymer tends to remain as a tightly coiled structure (i.e., a polymer-rich micelle) floating within a thin sea of smaller solvent molecules. 
     This condition results in very low viscosity mixtures even when the polymer&#39;s molecular weight is high and the polymer&#39;s melt index is quite low. This condition also produces exceedingly good dielectric contrast between the low dielectric polymer micelle and the surrounding high dielectric solvent and additive package. It is this micelle structure and the enormous differences in dielectric constant of the two materials that creates a large dielectrophoretic force when such a mixture is placed in a high electric field gradient. 
     Such high dielectric contrast requires that a polymer with a relatively low dielectric constant (which usually cannot be dispersed within a high dielectric solvent and additive mixture), is forced to form a stable dispersion with these materials. This allows the formulation of very powerful dielectric mixtures and the use of very small amounts of solvent to achieve a very low viscosity. 
     The presence of such a small amount of solvent may also make the process much more environmentally attractive, reduce costs, increase dry fiber net production, and allows the use of very simple equipment such as ordinary melt spray and melt-blown fiber systems. 
     Hybrid systems generally demand progressively smaller amounts of solvent as polymer molecular weight decreases. That is, while a very high molecular weight polymer grade could require 50-60% of solvent by weight to achieve a low-viscosity mixture that is easily converted to fibers, this drops to as little as 10-20% solvent when the molecular weight of the polymer decreases. Polymers of 5-80 melt index can be easily spun using ordinary melt spray equipment with 550 micron orifices. A simple hot-melt machine can be used to carry out this process. 
     In some cases, suitable solvents for a Hybrid composition may have high boiling points and low volatility. As such, the heating of the Hybrid composition will tend not to cause aggressive evaporation of the solvent (as contrasted with conventional solvent-based electrospinning in which solvents often have low boiling points and are highly volatile, thus reacting very aggressively to heat). 
     In some embodiments, suitable polymers may include low melt index polymers as well as polymers that have traditionally be considered to be “unspinnable” or extremely difficult to convert into fibers according to conventional teachings. For example, some suitable polymers may include polycarbonate (PC) and poly(vinylidene difluoride) (PVDF). 
     Note that the discussion herein with respect to Hybrid systems should not be confused with the discussion related to propylene carbonate solvent above even though the same acronym is used (PC) in both cases. 
     When using Hybrid compositions, it is believed that performance may be improved when the solvent is not particularly good at dissolving the polymer. By definition, the Hansen Solubility Parameters between a polymer of lower dielectric constant are not accurately matched to a solvent and additive mixture that have high or very high dielectric constants. The polarization parameter of the two materials is clearly and purposely not matched. In general, this also means that the dispersion and hydrogen bonding parameters are also generally not matched and possibly extremely poorly matched. For dielectrophoretic spinning, this is beneficial for achieving good results. 
     Moreover, in the Hybrid system, it is generally believed that the solvent is acting as a “lubricant” between polymer micelles, as opposed to fully dissolving the polymer (as in conventional polymer-solvent systems). This arrangement allows much less solvent to be used in Hybrid compositions than is normally required in conventional solvent-based electrospinning systems or even lower-temperature dielectrophoretic spinning systems. As such, it is beneficial to have a deliberate mismatch between the solvent and the polymer to encourage the formation of polymer micelles and to use heat to overcome this mismatch. 
     In some embodiments, various dielectrophoretic additives as generally described herein may also be added to the Hybrid compositions, and these may be used to for further reduce the size of particles that are formed. 
     Hybrid Experiment #1 
     In a first Hybrid experiment, a polymer solution was prepared that comprised 50% polycarbonate (PC) polymer (with a melt flow index of 80) dispersed in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solvent. 
     The DMSO solvent was used as a functional dielectric additive and the spinning process was carried out using a conventional melt spray unit with four 550 micron diameter orifices in a 1″ wide emitter. These orifices are located adjacent to slots that allow heated process air to emerge at elevated velocity to create a pre-fiber (pre-particle) that can be further attenuated within an electric field created by a circular electrode located in front of the orifices. 
     The solution was prepared by heating a vessel of DMSO to a temperature between 140-170 degrees Celsius. Next, the PC pellets were added gradually over time in such a manner that all the PC pellets dissolved in the DMSO and the solution remained in a liquid state before any subsequent PC pellets were added. The addition of PC pellets continued until the final solution composition (50% PC, 50% DMSO) was achieved. 
     It has been observed that if all or too many PC pellets are added to the DMSO at once, the PC pellets may not adequately dissolve and the mixture tends to remain paste-like, with some PC pellets being dissolved in the DMSO, while some PC pellets remaining un-dissolved. Adding all the PC pellets at once thus appears to be unsuitable for producing a uniform dispersion of PC in DMSO. 
     During the dielectrophoretic spinning of this composition, the operating conditions were generally as follows:

     For this experiment, the average diameter of the resulting fibers was approximately 299 nanometers. This average dropped to 258 nanometers if the largest 5% of the fibers were excluded from the sample. The standard deviation of the fibers was approximately 252 nanometers. Dry fiber production for the melt spray system is usually about 0.5 grams/orifice-minute 
     This experiment was repeated with alternative mixtures of PC having a melt index as low as 10 dispersed into DMSO. One would ordinarily not expect PC to be spinnable into any kind of high-quality fiber, but even this low melt index grade was readily spun. What is particularly surprising here is that this result is achieved prior to the addition of more sophisticated additives and dispersants that can further drive fiber size down and production rates up. 
     Hybrid Experiment #2 
     A second experiment was conducted using a second composition that comprised a simple mixture of 25% polymer (K2850-04 P(VDF-HFP)) dispersed in 75% DMSO. The experimental setup was generally similar as to the first Hybrid experiment described above. 
     For this experiment, the average diameter of the resulting fibers was approximately 626 nanometers. This average dropped to 564 nanometers if the largest 5% of the particles were excluded from the sample. The standard deviation of the particles was approximately 385 nanometers. 
     What is particularly interesting about this second experiment is that it demonstrates that the production of PVDF nanofibers can be carried out using an ordinary melt spray machine with large orifices of 550 micron diameter. Hence, PVDF can be melt sprayed into nanofibers with a relatively un-complicated mixture. Additional dielectric additives and other enhancements can be used to drive fiber size downward and production rates up. However, even uncomplicated high dielectric contrast mixtures can be converted to nanofibers in this system. 
     Discussion of Hybrid Experiments 
     These results confirm that small particles can be formed using higher concentrations of polymers than were normally considered possible. In particular, the first example demonstrates that it is possible to form small polycarbonate particles using only 50% by weight solvent. 
     It is also notable that DMSO is not a particularly good solvent for PC. In particular, as discussed above, the PC pellets were added gradually over time under the application of heat to encourage the Hybrid composition to maintain a liquid state. When the PC pellets were added too quickly, the resulting mixture was non-homogeneous. This tends to support the conclusion that less than perfect solubility is not a barrier to forming small particles, and may in fact be connected to the mechanisms for high-quality particle formation. 
     It is also noted that the Hybrid compositions discussed herein may be suitable for use in other particle formation systems. In particular, it is believed that in addition to D-spinning these hybrid compositions, it may also be possible to electrospin suitable Hybrid compositions. In fact, such dispersions appear to be suitable for ordinary melt-blowing and spun bonding processes as well as direct filament extrusion into fiber. That is, these systems can be used to not only produce fibers with electrically-enhanced methods of attenuation, but can be used to produce a spin dope for other processes that are well known in the art. Here, it is not necessary to match or not match the dielectric properties of the polymer and solvent. 
     What is particularly useful is the application of a solvent that can handle the elevated temperature (without decomposing or causing excessive pressure) within the heating apparatus. A polymer of exceedingly high molecular weight can be processed in this fashion through conventional spinning equipment by using relatively minor amounts of solvent. 
     While the above description provides examples of one or more apparatus, methods, or compositions, it will be appreciated that other apparatus, methods, or compositions may be within the scope of the present description as interpreted by one of skill in the art.","The invention claimed is:

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     As required, detailed embodiments of the present invention are disclosed herein; however, it is to be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention that may be embodied in various forms. Therefore, specific functional details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting, but merely as a basis for the claims and as a representative basis for teaching one skilled in the art to employ the present invention in various ways. 
     In one embodiment, the present invention relates to a cosmetic or skin care formulation comprising at least one pearl and the pearl is selected from a group consisting essentially of natural pearls, cultured pearls, Japanese cultured pearls, freshwater pearls, salt water pearls, keshi pearls, mabe pearls and mixtures thereof. Natural pearls are formed by nature without instigation from human beings. 
     Natural pearls are formed around an irritant such as a grain of sand, apiece of coral or seashell. Cultured pearls are generally formed the same way as natural pearls and the only difference is the irritant is introduced by man (the nucleus is inserted into the oyster by man) and the oysters are raised in a controlled environment. Japanese cultured pearls (including akoya pearls) are generally smaller in size than south sea pearls and colors include white, cream, gold and rose. Freshwater cultured pearls are farmed in freshwater and grown in mussels. Freshwater pearls cultivating techniques usually produce twenty or more pearls in one oyster, and it only takes one and a half years to two years to harvest. Saltwater cultured pearls are farmed in saltwater and grown in oysters. Unlike saltwater pearls, only one pearl is grown per oyster and needs two years and a half to get good harvest. The colors of the saltwater pearls are white, cream, yellow, gold, silver, rose and black. Countries that are producers are Burma, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Australia and Tahiti. Keshi pearls are very small pearl byproducts of the pearl culturing process. If debris enters an oyster while it&#39;s open during the harvesting process, the oyster covers the debris with nacre, thus creating keshi pearls. Mabe pearls are created when human attaches a plastic dome to the inside shell of an oyster, which reacts by covering the dome with nacre. 
     In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a cosmetic or skin care formulation comprising at least one tea and the tea is selected from a group consisting essentially of white tea, black tea, green tea, red tea, oolong tea, herbal tea and mixtures thereof. 
     Black teas are oxidized; this means that the leaves are exposed to the air for a precise length of time in order to allow natural chemical reactions to occur. These reactions change the leaves&#39; color from green to copper and intensify their flavor until it is rich and complex. Earl Grey, English Breakfast and Darjeeling are some examples of black teas. 
     Green teas are not oxidized; they are merely withered and dried. Green teas include Lung Ching, Bancha and Sencha. Green tea also has HGCG; the most powerful antioxidant known. 
     Oolong teas are a combination of green and black leaves. They are partly fermented and stronger than green teas, but are more delicate than the fully fermented black teas. Oolong tea, like black tea goes through a withering stage (wilting). The difference is the oolong tea, goes through a shorter stage and the leaves are fired directly after that to prevent continued oxidation (fermentation.) The leaves can range from being almost black to dark green depending on when oxidation is stopped. The longer the leaves are oxidized the closer to black tea they will become. Black Dragon and Pouchong (Pao-Chung) are samples of oolong teas. 
     China whites, produced exclusively in China and highly prized, are simply steamed and dried. White tea is the least processed tea. The leaves are picked early in the year while the tiny white hairs are still visible on the leaves and the bud is still closed. Only the top leaf and a bud are picked from the plant. The leaves are then allowed to dry in the sun; they are not steamed or pan fired like green tea. White teas include Flowery White Pekoe, Silver Needles and Noble Beauty. 
     Herbal teas are often called “tisanes” or “infusions”. Chamomile and Peppermint are just two of the many herbal teas available today. Red tea is also a sample of herbal teas and derived from the South African herb Roobios. 
     In another embodiment, the present invention relates to a cosmetic or skin care formulation comprising at least one exotic fruit and the fruit is selected from a group consisting essentially of miracle fruit, Barbados cherry, peanut butter fruit, sugar apple, wampi, imbé, Spanish lime, langsat, black sapote, papaya, velvet apple, mabolo, soursop, guanabana, mangosteen, okari nut, passion fruit, rambutan, banana, plantain, mango, sapodilla, red banana, canistel, egg fruit, citron, pummelo, monstera, green papaya, pineapple, durian, star fruit, coconut, Jake fruit, pomegranate and mixtures thereof. 
     In one embodiment, the formulation is manufactured by selecting at least one pearl, selecting at least one tea and selecting at least one fruit and admixing the pearl, tea and fruit. 
     In another embodiment, a skin care formulation is prepared and at least one pearl or one tea or one fruit is selected and admixed with the prepared formulation. 
     In a further embodiment, the formulation may further comprise an herbal extract selected from a group consisting essentially of angelica extract, ashwaganda extract, astragalus extract, bilberry extract, black cohosh extract, blue cohosh extract, blessed thistle extract, burdock extract, California poppy extract, cactus extract, celandine extract, chamomile extract, chaparral extract, chaste tree extract, chickweed extract, cleavers extract, coltsfoot extract, corn silk extract, cramp bark extract, damiana extract, dandelion extract, devil&#39;s claw extract, dong quai extract, echinacea extract, sib ginseng extract, eyebright extract, false unicorn root extract, fenugreek extract, ginkgo extract, ginseng root extract, goldenrod extract, goldenseal extract, gotu kola extract, horsetail extract, hyssop extract, kava kava extract, lady&#39;s mantle extract, licorice root extract, milk thistle extract, motherwort extract, nettle extract, oats extract, Oregon grape root extract, osha root extract, passionflower extract, pau d&#39;arco extract, plantain extract, red clover extract, red root extract, reishi mushroom extract, sarsaparilla extract, saw palmetto extract, St. John&#39;s wort extract, schisandra berry extract, shepherds purse extract, skullcap extract, slippery elm extract, usnea lichen extract, uva ursi extract, valerian extract, wild cherry extract, wild yam extract, wormwood extract, yellow dock extract, yucca root extract and mixtures thereof.

     PRIORITY CLAIM 
     This application claims priority under 35 U.S.C. §119(f) of the Community plant variety office (CPVO) application No. 2012/0100 filed Jan. 16, 2012. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates to a new and distinct variety of Apple tree, botanically known as  Malus domestica  Borkh. of the Rosaceae family, and hereinafter referred to by the variety denomination ‘Imara’. 
     The new  Malus  variety is a product of a controlled breeding program conducted by the inventor(s), Inge De Wit, Hendrik Eyssen, Johan Keulemans, Johan Nicolaï, Els Pauwels and Paul Van Laer, in Rillaar, Belgium. The objective of the breeding program was to develop a new  Malus  variety with scab resistance, good taste and texture, as well as good storage capacity and shelf life. 
     The new  Malus  variety originated from a cross made by the inventor(s) in 1990 in Belgium. The female or seed parent is the  Malus domestica  variety designated ‘LIBERTY’ (unpatented). The male or pollen parent is the  Malus domestica  variety designated ‘GRANNY’ (unpatented). The new  Malus  variety was discovered and selected by the inventors within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled environment in 1998 in Belgium. 
     Asexual reproduction of the new  Malus  variety by grafting onto rootstocks was first performed in the winter of 2008-2009 in Belgium, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new variety are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new variety reproduces true to type. 
     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘Imara’ which in combination distinguish this Apple tree as a new and distinct variety:
         1. multiple scab resistance;   2. powdery mildew and fire blight tolerance;   3. smooth skin;   4. white flesh; and   5. slight citrus aroma.       

     In comparison to the parental varieties, ‘LIBERTY’ and ‘GRANNY’, ‘Imara’ differs primarily in the traits listed in Table 1.

       [0001] 1. Field of the Invention  
       [0002] The present invention generally relates to portable telephone sets and data communication adaptors and, more particularly to a portable telephone set and a data communication adaptor used to build a mobile communication system that includes an information processing device.  
       [0003] Recently, portable telephone sets are being used not only for telephone communication but also used in combination with an information processing device for mobile communication. Accordingly, it is required that a portable telephone set be useful to build a mobile communication system.  
       [0004] 2. Description of the Related Art  
       [0005]FIGS. 1A and 1B show a portable telephone set  10  according to the related art and how a mobile communication system is built using the portable telephone set  10 .  
       [0006] The portable telephone set  10  has a connector  10   a  at the bottom thereof connectable to a connector of a cable.  
       [0007]FIG. 1A shows a mobile communication system  30  using an information processing device  20  not having a built-in data communication adaptor. The mobile communication system  30  is built using the information processing device  20 , a cable  40  with connectors and a data communication adaptor  50 . A connector  40   a  at an end of the cable  40  is connected to the connector  10   a  of the portable telephone set  10 . A connector  40   b  at the other end of the cable  40  is connected to a connector  50   a  at an end of the data communication adaptor  50 . The data communication adaptor  50  is inserted into a data communication adaptor accommodating unit  20   a  of the information processing device  20 . A connector  50   b  at the other end of the data communication adaptor  50  is connected to a connector  20   b  at the rear end of the data communication adaptor accommodating unit  20   a.    
       [0008] Normally, the data communication adaptor  50  is inserted into the data communication adaptor  20   a  of the information processing device  20 .  
       [0009]FIG. 1B shows how a mobile communication system  30 A is built using an information processing device  20 A having a built-in data communication adaptor. The information processing device  20 A has a built-in data communication adaptor  60 . The mobile communication system  30 A is built using the information processing device  20 A, the cable  40  with the connectors. The connector  40   a  at an end of the cable  40  is connected to the connector  10   a  of the portable telephone set  10  and the connector  40   b  at the other end is connected to a connector  60   a  of the data communication adaptor  60  built into the information processing device  20 A.  
       [0010] A user who intends to perform mobile communication carries the portable telephone set  10  with himself or herself. In addition, the user carries the information processing device  20  ( 20 A) and the cable  40  in, for example, a bag. If the cable  40  connected to the information processing device  20  ( 20 A) is accommodated in the bag, a intensive force is applied to the joint between the cable  40  and the information processing device  20  ( 20 A), causing the joint to be damaged. For this reason, the cable  40  is disconnected from the information processing device  20  ( 20 A) while being carried.  
       [0011] Therefore, the user may leave the cable  40  behind at home since it is comparatively small. If the cable  40  is lost, mobile communication is impossible.  
       [0012] Another inconvenience is that, since the cable  40  should be connected to the portable telephone set  10  as well as to the information processing device  20  ( 20 A), it takes time to build a mobile communication system.  
       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  
       [0013] Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a portable telephone set and a data communication adaptor in which the aforementioned problems are eliminated.  
       [0014] Another and more specific object of the present invention is to provide a portable telephone set and a data communication adaptor whereby a data communication system is more readily built than according to the related art.  
       [0015] The aforementioned objects can be achieved by a portable telephone set comprising: a telephone set main body; and a cable accommodating portion for accommodating a cable with a connector connectable with a mobile information processing device, wherein the cable is accommodated in the cable accommodating portion such that an end of the cable is electrically connected to the telephone set main body.  
       [0016] Since the cable with the connector is accommodated such that an end of the cable is electrically connected to the portable telephone set, it is not necessary for a user to carry the cable with him or her. The cable is not lost by any chance. For mobile communication, the user has only to take the cable out of the cable accommodating unit and is not required to connect the cable to the portable telephone set.  
       [0017] The aforementioned objects can also be achieved by a portable telephone set comprising: a telephone set main body; and a flipper attached to the telephone set main body, wherein the flipper includes a cable accommodating portion for accommodating a cable with a connector connectable with a mobile information processing device, and the cable is accommodated in the cable accommodating portion such that an end of the cable is electrically connected to the telephone set main body.  
       [0018] It is to be appreciated that it is easier to provide the cable accommodating unit in the flipper than in telephone set main body.

       [0026] By providing a mechanical supporting mechanism, the moment caused by the weight of the portable telephone set is born by the mechanical supporting mechanism while mobile communication using the mobile communication system is proceeding so that a bending force is prevented from being exerted on the joint between the connectors.  
       [0027] The mechanical supporting mechanism may be embodied by holes to which arm portions projecting from the portable telephone set and the connection adaptor.  
       [0028] According to this aspect of the invention, it is easy to construct the mechanical supporting mechanism.  
       [0029] Each of the holes may be provided on an inner surface thereof with a rib portion engageable with a groove on a side of each of the arm portions.  
       [0030] By engaging the rib portion with the groove on the side of the arm portion, the mechanical support is reinforced.  
       [0031] The aforementioned objects can also be achieved by a card-like data communication adaptor used for data communication when a portable telephone set is connected to a mobile information processing device, comprising: an adaptor main body; a top shield plate formed of a metal and covering an upper major surface of the adaptor main body; and a bottom shield plate formed of a metal and covering a lower major surface of the adaptor main body, wherein the adaptor main body comprises: a portable telephone set connector electrically connectable to one of the portable telephone set and a connection adaptor connected to the portable telephone set; and a mobile information processing device connector connectable to a mobile information processing device, and wherein the card-like data communication adaptor further comprises: a mechanical supporting mechanism to which arm portions projecting from one of the portable telephone set and the connection adaptor are inserted and which mechanically supports the data communication adaptor with respect to one of the portable telephone set and connection adaptor, the mechanical supporting mechanism being embodied by holes formed by incisions provided in the adaptor main body and by portions of the top shield plate and the bottom shield covering the incisions.  
       [0032] Since the shield plate is a formed of metal, the shield plate is not easily deformed. Accordingly, the mechanical support is reinforced.  
       [0033] Each of the incisions in the adaptor main body may be provided at an inner surface thereof with a rib portion engageable with a groove provided on a side of each of the arm portions.  
       [0034] By engaging the rib portion with the groove provided on the side of the arm portion, the mechanical support is reinforced.

The flipper joint plate main body  230  and the upper housing  201  are joined to each other such that the ring portions  230   a  and  230   b , the semi-cylindrical portion  230   c , the ring portions  201   a  and  201   b , and the semi-cylindrical portion  201   c  are aligned with each other. The hinge module  116   a  engaged with the ring portion  230   a  and the ring portion  201   a  adjacent to each other, and the hinge module  116   b  engaged with the ring portion  230   b  and the ring portion  201   b  adjacent to each other pivotally support the flipper joint plate  117 . An a-shaped loop  226   a  is formed in the middle of the flexible cable  226 . The a-shaped loop  226   a  is accommodated in a portion between the semi-cylindrical portion  201   c  and the semi-cylindrical portion  231   a  that are adjacent to each other. The diameter of the α-shaped loop  226   a  is increased when the flipper  111  ( 150 ,  180 ) is open and decreased when the flipper  111  ( 150 ,  180 ) is closed so that the stress produced in the flexible cable  226  is restrained.  
     [0092] The flipper joint plate main body  230  is provided with arm portions  230   d  and  230   e . The arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  are provided at respective ends that are opposite to the pivotally supported side of the flipper  230  so as to extend away from the pivotally supported side. A recess  230   f  is formed between the arm portions  230   d  and  230   e . The telephone set main body connector  118  is exposed at a bottom  230   f   1  of the recess  230   f.    
     [0093] The arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  are provided with longitudinally extending slits  230   d   1  and  230   e   1 , respectively, at the periphery thereof.  
     [0094] Adjacent to the arms  230   d  and  230   e  are provided locking pawls  232  and  233  for locking the flipper  111  ( 150 ,  180 ), respectively, and operation buttons  234  and  235 , respectively.  
     [0095] A description will now be given of the flipper  111 .  
     [0096] As shown in FIG. 6, the flipper  111  comprises a flipper main body  240 , an openable and closable cover  241  pivotally secured to the flipper main body  240 , the short cable  120  and a holder member  242 . When the cover  241  is closed, the cable accommodating portion  119  is formed. The flipper  111  is connected to the flipper joint plate  117  at a joint end  243 . Numeral  244  indicates an end opposite to the end  243 .  
     [0097] The flipper main body  240  is provided on the joint end  243  with guide passages  240   a  and  240   b  extending along the interior surface thereof, a notch  240   c  engageable with the operation button  234 , and an engaging hole  240   d  engageable with the locking pawl  232 . A notch and an engaging hole on the other side are not shown.  
     [0098] A holder member  242  secured to the interior of the flipper main body  240  holds the connector  122  of the short cable  120  and a joint portion  121   a  of the short cable main body  121  adjacent to the connector  122  in their places. A shaft portion  241   a  of the cover  241  is also secured in its place by the holder member  242 . As shown in FIG. 8B, the short cable main body  121  and the connector  123  of the short cable  120  are accommodated in the interior of the flipper main body  240 . The short cable main body  121  is appropriately bent such that it is guided under a cable holding portion  240   e  projecting toward the interior of the flipper main body  240 . The connector  123  is held between a rib  240   f  provided to extend along the periphery of the connector  123  and the inner wall of the flipper main body  240  such that the terminals faces the interior of the flipper main body  240 .  
     [0099] The cover  241  is rotatable around the shaft portion  241   a . When the cover  241  covers the cable accommodating portion  119  locking pawls  241   b  are engaged with recesses  240   g  at the respective surfaces of the inner wall-of the flipper main body  240 . The cover  241  covers the short cable  121  and the connector  123  when it is closed. Since the cover  241  is provided with side plates  241   c  immediately adjacent to the locking pawls  241   b , it is unlikely that a finger of a user is caught on the locking pawl  241   b . Thus the locking pawl  241   b  is prevented from being broken.  
     [0100] The cover  241  is also provided with notches  241   d  and  241   e  for pulling the short cable  121 . The flipper main body  240  is provided with a notch  240   h  at a position that corresponds to the notch  241   d.    
     [0101] The guide passages  240   a  and  240   b  of the flipper  111  are engaged with the arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  of the flipper joint plate  117 , respectively. The flipper  111  is mechanically coupled to the flipper joint plate  117  (telephone set main body  110 ) by the engaging holes  240   d  being engaged with the locking pawls  232  and  233  and is electrically connected to the flipper joint plate  117  (the telephone set main body  110 ) by the connector  122  being connected to the telephone set main body connector  118 . Thus, the portable telephone set  100  is constructed.  
     [0102] As shown in FIG. 7, the flipper  111  is normally closed so as to cover the operation buttons  113  of the telephone set main body  110 . A portion of the flipper  111  that corresponds to the microphone  223  is provided with an opening  226 .  
     [0103] A description will now be given of how the portable telephone set  100  is used.  
     [0104] When a telephone call is to be made, the flipper  111  is opened so that an appropriate operation is performed.  
     [0105] When mobile communication is to be performed, the mobile information processing device  130  having a built-in data communication adaptor as shown in FIG. 9B is taken out of the bag. The flipper  111  of the portable telephone set  100  is opened. The user applies a finger to the end of the cover  241  so as to open the cover  241  as indicated by the solid line in FIG. 8A and takes out the short cable  120  from the cable accommodating portion  119  and closes the cover  241  as indicated by the broken line in FIG. 8A. The short cable  120  may be guided through the notches  241   d  and  240   h  so as to extend from the end of the flipper  111 . As indicated by the alternate long and two short dashes line in FIG. 9A, the short cable  120  may alternatively be led out from the side of the flipper  111  via the notch  241   e.    
     [0106] As shown in FIG. 9 b , the connector  123  at the end of the short cable  120  is connected to the connector  131  of the mobile information processing device  130 .  
     [0107] Thus, the mobile communication system  140  enabling mobile communication is built.  
     [0108] [Portable Telephone Set  100 A According to the Second Embodiment] 
     [0109]FIGS. 10A and 10B show the portable telephone set  100 A. Like the flipper  111  already described, the flipper  150  is mechanically and electrically connected to the telephone set main body  110 . As shown in FIG. 10B, the short cable  152  is accommodated in the flipper  150 .  
     [0110] When a telephone call is to be performed, the flipper  150  is opened so that an appropriate operation is performed.  
     [0111] When mobile communication is to be performed, the mobile information processing device  170  as shown in FIG. 11 not having a built-in data communication adaptor is taken out of the bag. The data communication adaptor  160  is inserted into the mobile information processing device  170 . As shown in FIGS. 10A and 10B, the flipper  150  of the portable telephone set  100 A is opened so as to open the cover  241 . The short cable  152  is taken out of the cable accommodating portion  151 , whereupon the cover  241  is closed. The short cable  152  may be taken out in either of the two directions.  
     [0112] Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 11, the connector  153  at the end of the short cable  152  is connected to the connector  161  of the data communication adaptor  160  inserted into the mobile information processing device  170  not having a built-in data communication adaptor.  
     [0113] Thus, the mobile communication system  140 A enabling mobile communication is built.  
     [0114] [Portable Telephone Set  100 B According to the Third Embodiment] 
     [0115] The portable telephone set  100 B comprises the telephone set main body  110  and the flipper  180 . As shown in FIG. 12, the flipper  180  comprises a flipper main body  250 , an operation button member  251  fixed to the interior of the flipper main body  250 , and a cover  252  fixed to the interior of the flipper main body  250  and covering the operation button member  251 . The operation button member  251  is formed of rubber and is provided with three arm portions  251   a  parallel with each other. A button portion  251   b  is provided on the underside of each of the arm portions  251   a , and a projection  251   c  is provided on each of the arm portions  251   a . The flipper main body  250  is provided with openings  250   a  corresponding to the button portions  251   b . The cover  252  is provided with openings  252   a  corresponding to the projections  251   c . The button portion  251   b  is engaged with the opening  250   a  and the projection  251   c  is located in the opening  252   a.    
     [0116] Like the flipper  111  already described, the flipper  180  is mechanically joined to the telephone set main body  110 .  
     [0117] By pressing the button portion  251   b  while the flipper  180  is being closed, three main buttons  113   a ,  113   b  and  113   c  of the operation buttons  113  are pressed.  
     [0118] [Portable Telephone Set  100 C According to the Fourth Embodiment] 
     [0119] The portable telephone set  100 C according to the fourth embodiment includes the telephone set main body  110  as shown in FIG. 14A.  
     [0120] As shown in FIGS. 14A, 14B and  15 , when mobile communication is to be performed, the data communication adaptor  190  is mechanically joined to the flipper joint plate  117  of the telephone set main body  110 . The connector  122  is connected to the telephone set main body connector  118  for electrical connection.  
     [0121] Subsequently, as shown in FIG. 15, the data communication adaptor  190  joined to the telephone set main body  110  is inserted into the data communication adaptor accommodating unit  171 A. The connector  162  is connected to the connector  172  so that the data communication adaptor  190  is connected to the information processing device  170 A. Thus, the mobile communication system  140 B is built.  
     [0122] The data communication adaptor  190  is provided with holes  190   a  and  190   b  at respective sides thereof. The holes  190   a  and  190   b  are engaged with the arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  so that connection between the flipper joint plate  117  and the data communication adaptor  190  is reinforced.  
     [0123] [Variations] 
     [0124] In the above-described embodiments, the telephone set main body  110  is provided with a removable flipper. However, the flipper may be permanently attached to the telephone set main body  110 . In a portable telephone set in which a flipper is removable, the telephone set main body connector  118  is provided at the end of the flipper. In a portable telephone set in which a flipper is not removable, the telephone set main body connector  118  may be provided in the telephone set main body. That is, the connector  118  may constitute a part of the portable telephone set.  
     [0125] [Data Communication Adaptor  190  According to the Fifth Embodiment] 
     [0126] The data communication adaptor  190  shown in FIG. 14A has a construction as shown in FIGS.  16 - 20 C.  
     [0127] The data communication adaptor  190  functions as a PCMCIA card. As shown in FIG. 18, the data communication adaptor  190  comprises a main body  191  and metal shield covers  192  and  193  that cover the upper and lower surfaces of the main body  191 , respectively.  
     [0128] As shown in FIG. 19, the main body  191  is constructed such that a printed circuit module  195  is combined with a frame  194 . The printed circuit module  195  is constructed such that a plurality of electronic parts  195   b  are mounted on the upper and lower surfaces of a printed circuit board  195   a . The connector  122  connected to a portable telephone set is attached to the X 2  end of the printed circuit board  195   a  and the connector  162  connected to the mobile information processing device is attached to the X 1  end of the printed circuit board  195   a . The frame  194  is configured to adapt for the printed circuit module  195 . At the X 2  end, the frame  194  is provided with arm portions  194   a  and  194   b  projecting in the X 2  direction at the Y 1  end and the Y 2  end, respectively. A connector accommodating portion  194   c  accommodating the connector  122  is formed between the arm portions  194   a  and  194   b . A incision  194   d  extending in the Z 1 -Z 2  direction is provided between the arm portion  194   a  and the connector accommodating portion  194   c , and a incision  194   e  also extending in the Z 1 -Z 2  direction is provided between the arm portion  194   b  and the connector accommodating portion  194   c.    
     [0129] As shown in FIG. 20A, the shield cover  192  is provided with bent portions  192   a  and  192   b  at the Y 1  and Y 2  ends, respectively. The bent portions  192   a  and  192   b  are configured to be engageable with grooves  194   f  and  194   g , respectively, provided at the Y 1  and Y 2  ends of the frame  194 , respectively. The shield cover  193  is provided with bent portions  193   a  and  193   b  at the Y 1  and Y 2  ends, respectively. The bent portions  193   a  and  193   b  are also configured to be engageable with the grooves  194   f  and  194   g , respectively, provided at the Y 1  and Y 2  ends of the frame  194 , respectively. The shield covers  192  and  193  are electrically connected to the ground of the printed circuit module  195  and hermetically seal the printed circuit module  195 .  
     [0130] The Z 1  and Z 2  ends of the incisions  194   d  and  194   e  are covered by respective portions of the shield covers  192  and  193 . As shown in FIGS. 20A and 20B, the incision  194   d  and the shield covers  192  and  193  form the hole  190   a . As shown in FIGS. 20A and 20C, the incision  194   e  and the shield covers  192  and  193  form the hole  190   b . Each of the holes  190   a  and  190   b  has a relatively large depth A. The Z 1  and Z 2  end walls of the holes  190   a  and  190   b  have a relatively high mechanical strength since they are formed by respective portions of the shield covers  192  and  193 . The holes  190   a  and  190   b  constitute a mechanical supporting mechanism as claimed.  
     [0131] To insure locking of the data communication adaptor  190 , the arm portions  194   a  and  194   b  for locking of the data communication adaptor  190  are provided with recesses  194   a   1  and  194   b   1 , respectively, at the inner surfaces thereof and also provided with rib portions  194   a   2  and  194   b   2 , respectively, extending in the X 1 -X 2  direction.  
     [0132] The data communication adaptor  190  is provided with the connector  122  at the X 2  end thereof and the connector  162  at the X 1  end thereof.  
     [0133] In order to perform mobile communication, the data communication adaptor  190  is connected to the flipper joint plate  117  of the telephone set main body  110  such that the connector  122  is connected to the telephone set main body connector  118 . Subsequently, the data communication adaptor  190  connected to the telephone set main body  110  is inserted into the data communication adaptor accommodating unit  171 A such that the connector  162  is connected to the connector  172  for connection with the mobile information processing device  170 A. Thus, the mobile communication system  140 B is built. The end of each of the shield covers  192  and  193  is electrically connected to the ground terminal (not shown) exposed in the data communication adaptor accommodating unit  171 A of the mobile information processing device  170 A.  
     [0134] As shown in FIG. 15, while mobile communication is being performed by the mobile communication system  140 B, the telephone set main body  110  is located adjacent to the mobile information processing device  170 A so that a predetermined moment M that acts to bend a joint between the connector  122  and the telephone set main body connector  118  is exerted on the joint. The moment M is given by (W, which is a sum of the weight of the telephone set main body  110 , the force exerted on the telephone set main body  110  for operation thereof, an external force exerted on the telephone set main body  110 )×(L which is the length of an arm extending from the joint between the connector  122  and the telephone set main body  118  to the center of gravity of the telephone set main body  110 ). The mechanical supporting mechanism as mentioned above bears the moment M so that a bending force is prevented from being exerted on the joint between the connector  122  and the telephone set main body connector  118 .  
     [0135] A description will now be given of how the holes  190   a  and  190   b  provide a mechanical support.  
     [0136] When the mobile communication system  140 B has been built as shown in FIG. 14B, the arm portion  230   d  is inserted into the hole  190   a  by the distance A so as to come into contact with the rear end thereof, and the arm portion  230   e  is inserted into the hole  190   b  by the distance A so as to come into contact with the rear end thereof, as shown in FIGS. 21A, 21B and  21 C. FIGS. 21A, 21B and  21 C also show that the rib portion  194   a   2  is engaged with the slit  230   d   1 , the rib portion  194   b   2  is engaged with the slit  230   e   1 , the recess  194   a   1  is engaged with the locking pawl  232 , and the recess  194   b   1  is engaged with the locking pawl  233 .  
     [0137] The moment M is born such that, as shown in FIG. 21C, an edge  193   c  of the shield cover  193  facing an exit of the hole  190   a  bears a base  230   d   2  of the arm portion  230   d  and an edge  192   c  of the shield cover  192  facing a rear end of the hole  190   a  bears an end  230   d   3  of the arm portion  230   d , and, as shown in FIG. 21B, an edge  193   d  facing an exit of the hole  190   b  bears a base  230   e   2  of the arm portion  230   e  and an edge  192   d  facing a rear end of the hole  190   b  bears an end  230   e   3  of the arm portion  230   e . In this way, the arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  are supported at two locations at the Y 1  and Y 2  ends, respectively.  
     [0138] As shown in FIG. 21A, the moment M is also born by the engagement of the rib portions  194   a   2  and  194   b   2  with the slits  230   d   1  and  230   e   1 , respectively.  
     [0139] The metal shield covers  192  and  193  with which the arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  come into contact are known to have a relatively large rigidity. The distance B in the Z 1 -Z 2  direction of the holes  190   a  and  190   b  is substantially identical to the thickness C of the data communication adaptor  190 . Thus, the thickness of the arm portions  230   d  and  230   e  is relatively large. Accordingly, the mechanical support provided by the holes  190   a  and  190   b  is sufficient to bear the moment M. Thus, the joint between the connector  122  and the telephone set main body connector  118  is free from a bending force. Thus, the connection between the connector  122  and the telephone set main body connector  118  is prevented from being loosened. It is unlikely that the connector  122  and the telephone set main body connector  118  are bent while the connection is established or that terminals of the connector  122  or the telephone set main body connector  118  are damaged. Thus, the life of the connectors  122  and  118  is prevented from being excessively reduced.  
     [0140] [Variation of the Telephone Set Main Body] 
     [0141]FIG. 22A shows a telephone set main body  110 A which is a variation of the telephone set main body  110  of FIG. 3. The telephone set main body  110 A comprises the liquid crystal display unit  112 , the operation buttons  113  and the antenna  114 . A connector  350  is provided at the lower end of the telephone set main body  110 A.  
     [0142] A connection adaptor  351  is used for the telephone set main body  110 A. The connection adaptor  351  comprises the hinge mechanism  115  and the flipper joint plate  117 . A connector  352  is provided on the upper end of the connection adaptor  351 .  
     [0143] The connection adaptor  351  is used to connect the data communication adaptor  190  to the telephone set main body  110 A.  
     [0144] The data communication adaptor  190  is connected to the telephone set main body  110 A such that the connector  352  is connected to the connector  350  so that the connection adaptor  351  is electrically and mechanically connected to the lower end of the telephone set main body  110 A. The data communication adaptor  190  is then connected to the flipper joint plate  117  of the connection adaptor  351 . Thus, a data communication system as shown in FIG. 22B results. The mechanical supporting mechanism is operated as described already.

US-2003009852-A1,"A hinge assembly ( 1 ) used for a foldable cellular telephone, wherein a pair of abutment members ( 5, 6 ) are forcibly rotated by the biasing force of a bias means ( 7 ) to a neutral position where the center parts of the projection ( 54 ) and the recess ( 64 ) of the abutment members are generally aligned with each other in circumferential direction, the projection is brought into contact with the recess at both side parts of the abutment members in circumferential direction when the pair of abutment members are rotated to the neutral position, and the outer surface of the projection and both side surfaces of the recess in circumferential direction should desirably be formed in an arcuate surface and an outwardly projecting arcuate surface, respectively.","TECHNICAL FIELD  
       [0001] This invention relates to a hinge assembly which is suited to be used for a foldable cellular telephone or the like.  
       BACKGROUND ART  
       [0002] In general, a foldable cellular telephone includes, as shown in FIGS. 18 and 19, a transmission section A and a reception section B. The transmission section A and the reception section B are turnably connected through a hinge assembly (not shown) for turning between a non-talk position where the transmission section A and the reception section B are abutted with each other as indicated by a solid line of FIG. 18 and a talk position as indicated by a solid line of FIG. 19. Moreover, when the angle formed between the transmission section A and the reception section B is smaller than a, the transmission section A and the reception section B are turned into a non-talk position by bias means built in the hinge assembly and held in that position. When the angle formed between the transmission section A and the reception section B is brought to be larger than a predetermined angle β, the transmission section A and the reception section B are turned into the talk position by bias means and held in that position.  
       [0003] As shown in FIG. 20, the hinge assembly includes a pair of abutment plates (abutment members) C,D arranged in mutually opposing relation and bias means (not shown) for biasing the paired abutment plates C,D towards each other. The pair abutment plates C,D are non-turnably connected to the transmission section A and the reception section B, respectively. Therefore, the abutment plates C,D are relatively turned as the transmission section A and the reception section B are turned.  
       [0004] The abutment plate C has a pair of projections C 1 , C 1  which are formed on its opposing surface with respect to the abutment plate D and which are arranged 180 degrees away from each other in the circumferential direction. The remaining abutment plate D also has a pair of recesses D 1 , D 1 , which are formed on its opposing surface with respect to the abutment plate C and which are arranged 180 degrees away from each other in the circumferential direction. The projection C 1  and the recess D 1  retain the transmission section A and the reception section B in a non-talk position or in a talk position with the help of the biasing force of the bias means.  
       [0005] Specifically, as shown in FIG. 21, the projection C 1  and the recess D 1  are arcuate in section. When the transmission section A and the reception section B are in the non-talk position, the projection C 1  and the recess D 1  are, as shown in FIG. 21(A), abutted with each other at areas which are slightly circumferentially away from their centers. Owing to this arrangement, the biasing force of the bias means is converted into a rotational biasing force (rotation biasing force for turning the abutment plate D in a direction opposite to the arrowed direction) for turning the abutment plate C in the arrowed direction. By this rotational biasing force, the transmission section A and the reception section B are held in the non-talk position. As shown in FIG. 21(B), when the angle formed between the transmission section A and the reception section B is β or less, an area which is slightly away from the central part of the projection C 1  contact one end portion of the recess D 1 . By this, the abutment plate C is biased in the arrowed direction of FIG. 21(B) and the transmission section A an the reception section B are turned in the non-talk position. When the angle formed between the transmission section A and the reception section B is β or more, the projection C 1  and the recess D 1  are brought into a symmetrical state with respect to the state shown in FIG. 21(B). Accordingly, the abutment plate C is biased in a direction opposite to the arrowed direction and the transmission section A and the reception section B are turned as far as to the talk position. When the transmission section A and the reception section B are located in the talk position, the projection C 1  and the recess D 1  are press-contacted at their central areas with each other as shown in FIG. 21(C). In that connection, the biasing force of the bias means merely urges the projection C 1  against the bottom surface of the recess D 1  and is never converted into a rotational biasing force. However, when the abutment members C,D are turned into either one direction from the position (hereinafter referred to as the “neutral position”) shown in FIG. 21(C), the biasing force of the bias means is converted into a rotational biasing force and causes the abutment members C,D to return into the neutral position. Accordingly, the transmission section A and the reception section B are held in the talk position.  
       [0006] In the above hinge assembly, when the abutment members C,D are turned, even if slightly, from the neutral position, the biasing force of the bias means should, theoretically, be converted into a rotational biasing force for returning the abutment members C,D to the neutral position. Actually, however, since the nearby areas (central areas of the projection C 1  and the recess D 1  in the circumferential direction of the abutment members C,D) of the contact points between the projection C 1  and the recess D 1  in the neutral position are generally orthogonal to the biasing direction of the bias means, the biasing force of the bias means is hardly converted into the rotational biasing force in the position where the abutment members C,D are slightly turned from the neutral position, and the abutment members C,D are not returned to the neutral position. For this reason, the transmission section A and the reception section B are not positioned in the talk position with a decent degree of modesty. This results in a problem that play is liable to occur.  
       DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION  
       [0007] In order to solve the above problem, the features of the present invention reside in a hinge assembly comprising a pair of abutment members arranged in mutually opposing relation and capable of making relative rotation, and bias means for biasing the pair of abutment members, so as to be press contacted with each other, one of the pair of abutment members having a projection formed on an opposing surface thereof and extending radially of the abutment member, the other abutment member having a recess formed on an opposing surface thereof and allowing the projection to be brought therein and thereout in accordance with the relative rotation of the their abutment members, when the projection is brought into the recess, the pair of abutment members being forcibly turned to a neutral position, side view where central areas of the projection and recess in a circumferential direction of the abutment members are generally coincident with each other, the hinge assembly being characterized in that when the pair of abutment members are turned into the neutral position, the projection being brought into contact with the recess at opposite side portions in a circumferential direction of the member.  
       [0008] It is preferred that an outer surface of the projection is defined by an arcuate surface extending in a radial direction of the abutment member.  
       [0009] It is also preferred that opposite side surfaces of the recess in the circumferential direction of the abutment member is defined by an outwardly projecting arcuate surface.

     BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION  
     [0032] One mode for carrying out the invention, in which the invention is incorporated with a hinge assembly used for a foldable cellular telephone, will be described herein after with reference to FIGS. 1 through 16. It should be noted, however, the present invention can be applied to other hinge assemblies than a hinge assembly used for a foldable cellular telephone, inasmuch as those hinge assemblies are used for turnably connecting two turning members.  
     [0033] As shown in FIGS. 1 through 6, a hinge assembly  1  includes first and second fixed members  2 , 3 , a hinge pine  4 , a movable disc (abutment member)  5 , a fixed disc (abutment member)  6  and a coiled spring (bias means)  7 . Those components  2  through  7  are arranged with their axes aligned.  
     [0034] As shown in FIGS. 1 through 6 and FIG. 7, the first fixed member  2  has a bottom portion  21  at one end portion thereof and is open at the other end portion, thus exhibiting a cylindrical configuration with a bottom. The first fixed member  2  is non-turnably connected to one of the transmission section A and the reception section B with its axis aligned with the rotation axes of the transmission section A and the reception section B. A through hole  22  is formed in a central area of the bottom portion  21 . A pair of guide grooves  23 ,  23  axially extending from the open end face is formed in the open end portion side of a peripheral wall portion of the first fixed member  2 , The pair of guide grooves  23 ,  23  are 180 degrees away from each other in the circumferential direction.  
     [0035] The second fixed member  3  is non-turnably connected to the other of the transmission section A and the reception section B in such a manner as to be in opposing relation to the first fixed member. As shown in FIGS. 1 through 6 and FIG. 8, a receiving recess  31  is formed in an opposing surface of the second fixed member  3  with respect to the first fixed member  2 . A through hole  32  is formed in a central area of the first fixed member  2 .  
     [0036] As shown in FIG. 6, the hinge pin  4  includes a head portion  41 , an enlarged diameter portion  42 , a sectionally hexagonal fixed portion  43 , and a reduced diameter portion  44 , which are all arranged in order from one end portion thereof towards the other end portion. Those components  41  through  44  are formed such that their axes are aligned with one another. The enlarged diameter portion  42  is inserted into the through hole  22  until the head portion  41  hits the bottom portion  21  of the first fixed member  2 . The enlarged diameter portion  42  is turnably fitted to the through hole  22 . The reduced diameter portion  44  is inserted into the through hole  32  of the second fixed member  3 . After insertion, the second fixed member  3  is positionally fixed to the reduced diameter portion  44  by caulking the reduced diameter portion  44  utilizing a caulking hole  45  formed in a distal end face of the reduced diameter portion  45  so that the reduced diameter portion  44  is enlarged in diameter. The outside diameter of the reduced diameter portion  44  has a generally same diameter as a circle inscribing the hexagon which constitutes the fixed portion  43 .  
     [0037] As shown in FIGS. 1 through 6 and FIG. 9, the movable disc  5  includes a disc-like substrate portion  51 . This substrate portion  51  is axially movably inserted into the end portion on the open end portion side of the first fixed member  2 . A through hole  52 , into which the enlarged diameter portion  42  of the hinge pin  4  is relatively turnably and relatively movably inserted, is formed in a central area of the substrate portion  51 . A pair of guide portions  53 ,  53  are formed on the one and the other side portions of the substrate portion  51 . The movable disc  5  is axially movably but non-turnably connected to the first fixed member  2  by slidingly movably fitting the pair of guide portion  53 ,  53  to the guide grooves  23 ,  23  of the first fixed member  2 . Between the substrate portion  51  of the movable disc  5  and the bottom portion  21  of the first fixed member  2 , the coiled spring  7  is disposed in its compressed state. The movable disc  5  is biased towards the second fixed member  3  side by the coiled spring  7 .  
     [0038] As shown in FIGS. 1 through 6 and FIG. 10, the fixed disc  6  includes a disc-like substrate portion  61  and a ridge  62  formed on a lower surface (surface on the reverse side of the movable disc  5  side) of the substrate portion  61 . The fixed disc.  6  is, as a whole, formed in a generally same configuration as the receiving recess  31 . The fixed disc  6  is fitted to the receiving recess  31 , thereby the fixed disc  6  is non-turnably connected to the second fixed member  3 . A through-hole  63  is formed in a central area of the fixed disc  6 . This through hole  63  has an inside diameter generally equal to the outside diameter of the reduced diameter portion  44  of the hinge pin  4 . A sectionally hexagonal fixed portion  43  is fixedly press fitted to the through hole  63 . By this, the fixed disc  6  and the second fixed member  3  are connected to the hinge pin  4  such that they are rotated in unison. This hinge pin  4  is not absolutely necessarily connected to the second fixed member  3  and the fixed disc  6  such that they are rotated in unison. The hinge pin  4  may be connected to the first fixed member  2  and the movable disc  5  such that they are rotated in unison. Alternatively, the hinge pin  4  may be connected to the first and second fixed members  2 , 3 , the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  so that they can all rotate.  
     [0039] The fixed disc  6  is received by the second fixed member  3  in the direction towards the second fixed member  3  side from the first fixed member  2  side. Accordingly, the opposing surface  5   a  of the movable disc  5  is pressed against the opposing surface  6   a  of the fixed disc  6  by the coiled spring  7 . As shown in FIGS. 5, 6 and  9 , a pair of projections  54 ,  54  are formed on the opposing surface  5   a  of the movable disc  5  such that the projections  54 ,  54  are arranged 180 degrees away from each other on a circumference about the axis of the movable disc  5 . On the other hand, a pair of recesses  64 ,  64  are formed on the opening surface  6   a  of the fixed dis 6  such that the recesses  64 ,  64  are 180 degrees away from each other in the circumferential direction, as shown in FIGS. 5, 6 and  10 . The recess  64  is arranged on the same circumference as the projection  54 . Moreover, the length of the recess  64  in the radial direction of the discs  5 ,  6  is longer than that of the projection  54  in that direction.  
     [0040] As shown in FIGS. 11 and 12, the projection  54  is extended in the radial direction of the movable disc  5  with a predetermined width. The center line L 1  in the width direction is orthogonal to the axis of the movable disc  5 . The outer surface of the projection  54  is defined by an outwardly projecting arcuate surface, and the center line of this arcuate surface is, when viewed in the axial direction of the movable disc  5 , aligned with the center line L 1 . Accordingly, the projection  54  is symmetrical with respect to the center line L 1 . Its sectional configuration orthogonal to the center line L 1  is same, in any section. As a result, the projection  54  exhibits a square configuration, in which crossing ridge lines  54   a ,  54   a  between the projection  54  and the opposing surface  5   a  of the movable disc  5  is, when viewed in the axial direction of the movable disc  5 , parallel to the center line L 1 .  
     [0041] The recess  64  comprises an inner recess  65  formed on the inner side in the radial direction of the fixed disc  6  and an outer recess  66  formed on the outer side in the radial direction.  
     [0042] The inner recess  65  is extended in the radial direction of the fixed disc  6  with a predetermined width. The center line L 2  in its width direction is orthogonal to the axis of the fixed disc  6 . The sectional configuration orthogonal to the center line L 2  of the inner recess  65  is same in any section. Moreover, the inner recess  65  is symmetric with respect to the center line L 2 . Opposite side surfaces  65   a ,  65   a  (opposite side surfaces located in the circumferential direction of the fixed disc  6 ) of the inner recess  65  are defined by an outwardly projecting convexly curved surface. Especially, in this mode for carrying out the present invention, they are defined by an arcuate surface and the center of the arcuate surface is parallel to the center line L 2 . Moreover, one end portion of this arcuate surface is in contact with the opposing surface  6   a.    
     [0043] On the other hand, the outer recess  66  is formed in a sector-like configuration which is gradually increased in width towards the outer periphery side from the inner periphery side of the fixed disc  6  when viewed in the axial direction of the fixed disc  6 . The width of the inner periphery side end portion of the outer recess  66  is equal to the width of the inner recess  65 . The outer recess  66  is also symmetric with respect to the center line L 2 . Its side surface  66   a  is defined by an arcuate surface having a generally same radius of curvature as the arcuate surface which defines the side surface  65   a . One end portion of the arcuate surface which defines the side surface  66   a  is also in contact with the opposing surface  6   a . The arcuate surface which defines the side surface  66   a  and the arcuate surface which defines the side surface  65   a  are crossed with each other without leaving any step therebetween. The crossing ridge lines are denoted by reference numeric characters L 3 , L 4  of FIG. 11. The line L 5  connecting contact areas between the side surface  66   a  and the opposing surface  6   a  is orthogonal to the axis of the fixed disc  6 . Accordingly, the center line of the arcuate surface which defines the side surface  66   a , is parallel to the line L 5  but never crossed with the axis of the fixed disc  6 . The center line of the arcuate surface which defines the side surface  66   a  may be orthogonal to the axis of the fixed disc  6 . In that case, the line L 5  is not orthogonal to the axis of the fixed disc  6 .  
     [0044] The relation between the projection  54  and the inner and outer recesses  65 ,  66  will now be described. As shown in FIG. 11, when the transmission section A and the reception section B of the cellular telephone are located in the talk position, the center lines L 1 , L 2  are aligned with each other when viewed in the direction of the axes of the discs  5 ,  6 . The position of the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  at that time is the neutral position.  
     [0045] In the state in which the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  are located in the neutral position, the central area of the projection  54  is, as shown in FIG. 12, away from the bottom surface  65   b  of the inner recess  65  and only the opposite side portions of the projection  54  are in contact with the opposite side surfaces  65   a ,  65   a  of the inner recess  65 . Moreover, since the center line L 1  of the projection  54  and the center line of the arcuate surface which defines the side surface  65   a  of the inner recess  6  are parallel to each other, the projection  54  and the side surface  65   a  are in line contact (substantially in surface contact) as indicated by hatching of FIG. 11. On the other hand, since the outer recess  66  is increased in width as it goes outward away from the inner recess  65 , the projection  54  is, as shown in FIG. 13, is away from not only the side surface  66   a  of the outer recess  66  but also any surface which defines the outer recess  66 .  
     [0046] When the two discs  5 ,  6  are turned from the neutral position of FIGS. 11 and 12 within a range of a smaller angle than an angle α1, the projection  54  is brought into contact, as indicated by hatching of FIG. 14, with an end portion of the outer periphery side of the side surface  65   a  of the inner recess  65  and an end portion of the inner side of the side surface  66   a  of the outer recess  66 . It should be noted, however, that when the transmission section A and the reception section B are turned from the neutral position by an angle α, the center line L 2  and the line L 5  are aligned with each other when viewed in plan view. As a result, the central area of the projection  54  is brought into line contact with the side surface  65   a  (opposing surface  6   a ) on the line L 5 .  
     [0047] When the angle formed between the transmission section A and the reception section B is brought to be larger than β, a state symmetric with the state of FIG. 14 is realized.  
     [0048] In the hinge assembly  1  thus constructed, since the projection  54  and the inner recess  65  of the recess  64  are contacted with each other at two areas away in the circumferential direction of the discs  5 ,  6  when the transmission section A and the reception section B are turned into the talk position and the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  are brought into the neutral position, the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  can be positionally fixed with a decent degree of modesty. Accordingly, the transmission section A and the reception section B can surely be prevented from getting clattering in the talk position.  
     [0049] Moreover, in the hinge assembly  1  according to this mode for carrying out the present invention, since the recess  64  comprises a square inner recess  65  and a sector-like outer recess  66 , the projection  54  and the recess  64  can be prevented from getting worn off soon. That is, if the inner recess  65  should be extended towards the outer periphery side and the entire recess  64  should comprise of the inner recess  65 , the projection  54  and the side surface of the recess  64  would contact only at the end portion on the outer periphery side when the movable disc  5  should be moved, even slightly, from the neutral position with respect to the fixed disc  6 . For this reason, the projection  54  and the recess  64  are readily worn off soon.  
     [0050] On the other hand, in the hinge assembly  1  in which the recess  64  comprises the square inner recess  65  and the sector-like outer recess  66 , when the movable disc  5  is turned from the neutral position, an intermediate portion of the projection  54  in the radial direction of the movable disc  5  is brought into contact at an end portion Q on the outer periphery side with the side surface  65   a  of the inner recess  65  as indicated by hatching of FIG. 14. The same is true with respect to the case where the entire recess  64  comprises only the inner recess  65 . However, in this hinge assemblyl, the recess  64  includes the outer recess  66 , and the intermediate area of the projection  54  is contacted with the side surface  66   a  of the outer recess  66  also at its inner end portion R. Accordingly, the contact area between the projection  54  and the recess  64  is increased twice. Hence, the projection  54  and the recess  64  can be prevented from getting worn off soon.  
     [0051] As apparent from FIGS. 15 and 16, in the case where the side surfaces  65   a ,  66   a  of the recess  64  comprises the outwardly projected arcuate surface as in this hinge assembly  1 , the length of the contact area (area indicated by double hatching of FIG. 15) of the projection  54  with respect to the side surfaces  65   a ,  66   a  of the projection  54  when the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  are turned, is larger than the length of the contact area (area indicated by double hatching of FIG. 16) in the case where the bottom surface  64   a , which defines the recess  64 , comprises a concavely curved surface. By this, the projection  54  can more effectively be prevented from getting off soon.  
     [0052] It should be noted that the present invention should never be limited to the above-mentioned mode for carrying out the present invention. Instead, many changes and modifications can be made in accordance with necessity.  
     [0053] For example, in the above-mentioned mode for carrying out the present invention, although the recess  64  comprises the inner recess  65  and the outer recess  66 , it is also accepted that the inner recess  65  is extended outward at the outer recess and the entire recess  64  comprises the inner recess  65 .  
     [0054] As shown in FIG. 17, it is also accepted that the surface, which defines the recess  64 , comprises the concavely curved surface  64   a  at the width-wise central area and concavely curved surface  64   b  on the opposite sides. In this case, the concavely curved surface  64   a  comprises an arcuate surface having a smaller radius of curvature than the arcuate surface which defines the projection  54 , so that the projection  54  can contact the recess  64  at two areas which are away from each other in the circumferential direction when the movable disc  5  and the fixed disc  6  are turned into the neutral position. The concavely curved surface  64   b  comprises an arcuate surface having a larger radius of curvature than the arcuate surface which defines the projection  54 . With respect to the construction in which the recess  64  comprises only one concavely curved surface  64   a  on the center side and two concavely curved surface  64   b  on the width-wise opposite sides, the same is applicable to the recesses  65 ,  66  in which the recess  64  is divided into the inner recess  65  and the outer recess  66 .  
     [0055] Moreover, in the above-mentioned mode for carrying out the present invention, one pair of projections  54  and one pair of recesses  64  are arranged in such a manner as to be 180 degrees away from each other in the circumferential direction. It is also accepted, as in Japanese Patent Application Unexamined Publication No. H10-317779 (especially FIG. 12), that a pair of projections  54  are arranged at an angle less than 180 degrees, for example, about 160 degrees, and three recesses  64  are formed and arranged in a pattern of “Y”.

The hinge device includes a first resilient member for urging the first linearly moving member against the first rotating member, and a second resilient member for urging the second linearly moving member against the second rotating member.","FIELD OF THE INVENTION  
      The present invention relates to a hinge device, and more particularly, to a hinge device for coupling two units in a device such as a portable radiotelephone, a PDA or a portable computer comprising two coupled units that can be moved to folded and unfolded positions of the device with respect to each other.  
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  
      A portable device such as a portable folder-type radiotelephone includes two case units coupled to each other through a hinge device. Usually, one unit is provided with a keypad with buttons, and the other unit is provided with a liquid crystal display. When the radiotelephone is in use, the keypad and the liquid crystal display are moved to an unfolded position of the radiotelephone so that the keypad and display can be exposed to the outside. The hinge device allows the two units to be coupled to each other and to be smoothly moved to folded and unfolded positions of the radiotelephone.  
      A typical hinge device is constructed as follows. The hinge device comprises a rotating member, a linearly moving member, a resilient member, and a housing. The housing contains the rotating member, the linearly moving member and the resilient member. The rotating member can rotate about a rotation axis within the housing, and a portion of the rotating member protrudes outside of the housing to form a coupling portion. The linearly moving member is in contact with the rotating member, and does not rotate within the housing but moves linearly along a rotational shaft of the housing. The resilient member applies a force so that the linearly moving member and the rotating member can be brought into close contact with each other within the housing. At this time, contact surfaces of the linearly moving member and the rotating member are properly configured such that the rotating member easily rotates even without an external force in a certain range and is well maintained in a stationary state at a predetermined location.  
      One of two case units of a portable radiotelephone that are intended to be coupled to the hinge device constructed as above is fixed to the housing while the other is fixed to the coupling portion of the rotating member. The two units of the portable radiotelephone thus connected are maintained in the stationary state when they are at an unfolded or folded position of the radiotelephone through the operation of the hinge device. Further, in order to move the two units, which have been at the unfolded position or folded position of the radiotelephone, to the folded or unfolded position, a user should initially apply an external force to the two units with his/her hand in a certain range. In a range subsequent to the certain range, the two units are generally automatically moved to the folded or unfolded position.  
      However, the two case units of the portable folder-type radiotelephone with the hinge device constructed as above are difficult to move to the unfolded position through 180 or more degrees. Even though such movement of the two units may be established, the two units are not placed in the same plane or a portion of the two units protrudes from a plane due to the structure of the hinge device.  
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  
      An object of the present invention is to provide a hinge device for coupling two units in a device such as a portable radiotelephone comprising two coupled units that can rotate to folded and unfolded positions of the device with respect to each other. Another object of the present invention is to provide a hinge device for coupling the two units such that the units can move to an unfolded position at 180 or more degrees. A further object of the present invention is to provide a hinge device that allows the two units to be placed in the same plane when they have moved to the unfolded position at 180 degrees. A still further object of the present invention is to provide a hinge device that allows the two units to move to an unfolded position at 360 degrees.

      The first cam portion may include a horizontal surface contiguous to the first fixing groove, and stoppers at both ends thereof for preventing movement of the first cam follower portion. The horizontal surface of the first cam portion may be provided with at least one stopper groove relatively shallower than the first and second fixing grooves. The second cam portion may further include an upward slant surface, a horizontal surface, and a stopper at one end thereof for preventing movement of the second cam follower portion. On the contrary, the second cam portion may include an upward slant surface and a downward slant surface.  
      In one embodiment, one of the first rotating member and the first linearly moving member includes a first protrusion and the other includes a groove into which the first protrusion can be inserted, and one of the second rotating member and the second linearly moving member includes a second protrusion and the other includes a second groove into which the second protrusion can be inserted.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS  
       FIG. 1  is a perspective view of a portable folder-type radiotelephone employing a hinge device according to a first embodiment of the present invention. Referring to  FIG. 1 , a portable radiotelephone  5  includes a first unit  7  provided with a keypad, and a second unit  9  provided with a liquid crystal display. The first and second units  7  and  9  are rotatably coupled to each other by means of a hinge device  10 .  
      FIGS.  2  to  8  are views of the hinge device with two shafts according to the embodiment of the present invention shown in  FIG. 1 . In the hinge device of this embodiment, the two shafts are engagedly operated. Referring to  FIGS. 2   a  to  7 , the hinge device  10  includes a case  20 , first and second rotating members  30  and  40 , a linearly moving member  50 , first and second resilient members  98  and  99 , a supporting plate  100 , and a case cover  24 .  
      Referring to FIGS.  1  to  4 , the case  20  includes first and second end walls  21  and  22 , and a sidewall  23  for connecting the first and second end walls  21  and  23  to each other. The case cover  24  closes an opening that is not covered by the sidewall  23 . When the cover  24  is coupled to the case  20 , passage holes  201  are defined at both sides (only one side is shown in  FIG. 2   a ) of the hinge device adjacent to the second end wall  22 . The passage holes  201  communicate with a second chamber  27  of the case  20  to be described later. Electrical wires (preferably, a flexible printed cable) for connecting the first and second units  7  and  9  of the radiotelephone  5  to each other pass through the passage holes  201 . The first end wall  21  is provided with two through-holes  211  and  212 . The second end wall  22  is provided with first and second cylindrical coupling stubs  221  and  222  protruding outside at positions corresponding to the two through-holes  211  and  212  formed at the first end wall  21 . Although not specifically shown in the figures, the first and second coupling stubs  221  and  222  are inserted into coupling holes provided in the first unit (designated by reference numeral  7  in  FIG. 1 ) and the second unit (designated by reference numeral  9  in  FIG. 1 ) of the portable radiotelephone (designated by reference numeral  5  in  FIG. 1 ), respectively. The units freely rotate with respect to the respective coupling stubs. A first rotation axis  105  passes through the center of the first coupling stub  221  and the center of a first rotating member  30  to be described later. The first unit  7  of the portable radiotelephone  5  rotates about the first rotation axis  105  with respect to the hinge device  10 . A second rotation axis  110  passes through the center of the second coupling stub  222  and the center of a second rotating member  40  to be described later. The second unit  9  of the portable radiotelephone  5  rotates about the second rotation axis  110  with respect to the hinge device  10 .  
      Referring to  FIGS. 3 and 4 , a supporting wall  25  is provided in the case  20  to be parallel with the two end walls  21  and  22  at an intermediate position therebetween. The supporting wall  25  is provided with U-shaped passages  251  and  252  at positions corresponding to the two through-holes  211  and  212  formed at the first end wall  21 , respectively. The inner space of the case  20  is partitioned by the supporting wall  25  into a first chamber  26  on the side of the first end wall  21  and the second chamber  27  on the side of the second end wall  22 . The first chamber  26  contains the first and second rotating members  30  and  40 , a linearly moving member  50 , first and second resilient members  98  and  99 , and a supporting plate  100 , which will be described later.  
      Referring to  FIGS. 3, 4  and  6 , the first and second rotating members  30  and  40  take the shape of elongated posts extending between the first end wall  21  and the supporting wall  25  of the case  20 . The two rotating members  30  and  40  are configured to be the same as or symmetric with each other. The first and second rotating members  30  and  40  include first and second gear portions  32  and  42 , first and second coupling portions  34  and  44 , first and second cam follower portions, and first and second extension rods  38  and  48 , respectively. Only the second rotating member  40  will be described in detail below. A gear  41  is formed on a peripheral surface of the second gear portion  42  and engaged with a gear  31  of the first gear portion  32  so that the gears can be engaged with each other to rotate in opposite directions. A side surface of the second gear portion  42  is placed in the first chamber  26  of the case  20  to face the first end wall  21 . The second coupling portion  44  is provided with a key surface  43  and extends from the second gear portion  42  to protrude outside of the case  20  through the through-hole  212  of the first end wall  21 . Although not specifically shown in the figures, the first and second coupling portions  34  and  44  of the first and second rotating members  30  and  40  are engaged with the coupling holes formed in the first unit (designated by reference numeral  7  in  FIG. 1 ) and the second unit (designated by reference numeral  9  in  FIG. 1 ) of the portable radiotelephone (designated by reference numeral  5  in  FIG. 1 ), respectively, to rotate together with the units. The second extension rod  48  extends from the second gear portion  42  to the supporting wall  25  of the case  20  so that a distal end of the second extension rod can be fitted into the passage  252 . The second cam follower portion is provided with two cam follower protrusions  46  placed at an interval of 180 degrees. The two cam follower protrusions  46  protrude from the second gear portion  42  at both lateral sides of the second extension rods  48 .  
      Referring to  FIGS. 3, 4  and  5 , the linearly moving member  50  includes a base plate  52 , and first and second cam portions  54  and  56  formed on the base plate  52 . Through-holes  541  and  561  are formed at the centers of the first and second cam portions  54  and  56 , respectively. The extension rods  38  and  48  of the first and second rotating members  30  and  40  are fitted into the through-holes  541  and  561  so that the first and second cam portions  54  and  56  can face and cooperate with the cam follower protrusions  36  and  46  of the first and second rotating members  30  and  40 .  
      A profile of a cam surface of the first cam portion  54  and a profile of a cam surface  57  of the second cam portion  56  are symmetric with each other about a centerline for separating the two cam portions. A portion of the profile of the cam portion  55  of the cam surface  55  corresponding to one cam follower  36  is shown in  FIG. 7 , wherein exemplary values of angles are also shown. The cam profile shown in  FIG. 7  appears twice at an interval of 180 degrees on the first cam portion  54 . Referring to  FIG. 7 , the cam surface  55  sequentially includes an upward slant surface  551 , a downward slant surface  552 , a first insertion groove  553 , a horizontal surface  554 , and a second insertion groove  555 . A high and steep wall is placed next to the second insertion groove  555  so that the cam follower protrusion  36  cannot proceed further. The cam follower protrusion  36  moves between a location (position P 1 ) on the upward slant surface  551  and the second insertion groove  555 .  
      Referring to  FIGS. 3 and 4 , the first and second resilient members  98  and  99  are compression coil springs and fitted around the first and second extension rods  38  and  48  of the first and second rotating members  30  and  40 , respectively. One side of each of the first and second resilient members  98  and  99  is in contact with the linearly moving member  50  and the other side is in contact with the supporting plate  100 , which will be described later, to urge the linearly moving member  50  against the cam follower protrusions  36  and  46 .  
      Referring to  FIGS. 3 and 4 , the supporting plate  100  is contained in the first chamber  26  of the case  20  to be disposed between the supporting wall  25  and the resilient members  98  and  99 . The supporting plate  100  is provided with two passages  101  and  102  through which the first and second extension rods  38  and  48  of the first and second rotating members  30  and  40  pass. The supporting plate  100  facilitates assembly works by beforehand compressing the first and second resilient members  98  and  99 .  
      Now, the operation of the hinge device according to this embodiment will be described with reference to FIGS.  2  to  8 . As shown in  FIG. 2 , the first and second rotating members  30  and  40  rotate in opposite directions at the same angle since they are connected by means of the gears  31  and  41 .  FIG. 8  shows the corresponding positions of the second unit  9  of the portable radiotelephone  5  when the cam follower protrusion  36  of the first cam follower portion is located at positions P 1 , P 2 , P 3  and P 4  on the cam surface  55  of the first cam portion  54  shown in  FIG. 7 . Although not shown in the figure, a cooperative relationship between the second cam portion  56  and the cam follower protrusion  46  of the second cam follower portion is the same as that between the first cam portion  54  shown in  FIG. 7  and the first cam follower portion. As for same positions P 1  to P 4 , the angles shown in  FIG. 8  are twice as large as the relevant angles shown in  FIG. 7 . It can be understood by those skilled in the art that this is because  FIG. 7  shows the rotation angle of the first rotating member  30  connected to the first unit  7  of the portable radiotelephone  5 , whereas the rotation angle of the second unit  9  with respect to the first unit  7  shown in  FIG. 8  is the sum of the rotation angles of the first and second rotating members  30  and  40 .  
      Referring to  FIGS. 7 and 8 , position P 1  corresponds to a state where the second member  9  is at a fully folded position of the radiotelephone. Since the cam follower protrusion  36  is placed on the upward slant surface  36 , the radiotelephone  5  receives a force so that it can be continuously maintained in the folded state. In a range from position P 1  to position P 2 , the first unit  7  of the portable radiotelephone  5  rotates from 0 to 15 degrees with respect to the hinge device  10 . In this range, the first unit  7  is subjected to a force that causes it to automatically move to the folded position of the portable radiotelephone by means of the cooperation of the cam follower protrusion  36  and the upward slant surface  551 . Further, the angle between the first and second units  7  and  9  of the radio radiotelephone  5  in this range increases from 0 to 30 degrees. In a range from position P 2  to position P 3 , the first unit  7  of the portable radiotelephone  5  rotates from 15 to 65 degrees with respect to the hinge device  10 . In this range, the first unit  7  is subjected to a force that causes it to automatically move to an unfolded position of the portable radiotelephone by means of cooperation between the cam follower protrusion  36  and the downward slant surface  552 . Further, the angle between the first and second units  7  and  9  of the radio radiotelephone  5  in this range increases from 30 to 130 degrees. At position P 3 , the cam follower protrusion  36  is inserted into and stops in the first insertion groove  553 . At any location between positions P 3  and P 4 , a force is exerted on the second unit  9  to stop thereat. Position P 4  is a position where the first unit  7  of the portable radiotelephone  5  has rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the hinge device  10 . At position P 4 , the cam follower protrusion  36  is inserted into and stops in the second insertion groove  555 .  FIG. 3  shows the hinge device in this state.  
      The cam surface may be configured as shown in  FIG. 9  differently to that shown in  FIG. 7 . That is, a cam surface  58  sequentially includes an upward slant surface  581 , a first horizontal surface  582 , a first insertion groove  583 , a second horizontal surface  584 , and a second insertion groove  585 . A high wall is placed next to the second insertion groove  585  so that the cam follower protrusion  36  cannot proceed further. When the cam follower protrusion  36  is located at position P 1 , the portable radiotelephone is maintained in the fully folded state. When the cam follower protrusion  36  is located at position P 4 , i.e. in the second insertion groove  585 , the portable radiotelephone is fixed at an unfolded position at 180 degrees (at position P 4  shown in  FIG. 8 ). When the cam follower protrusion  36  is located at position P 3 , i.e. in the first insertion groove  583 , the angle between the two units of the portable radiotelephone becomes 130 degrees in a state corresponding to P 3  in  FIG. 8 . When the cam follower protrusion  36  is located on the first or second horizontal surface  582  or  584 , the portable radiotelephone is maintained in a stationary state at an arbitrary position. Although the first insertion groove  553  or  583  has been shown in  FIGS. 7 and 9  as being located to define 65 degrees, the present invention is not limited thereto. The first insertion groove  553  or  583  may be located at any positions to be formed at a variety of different angles.  
      Although the operating angles of the hinge device have been described by way of examples in the aforementioned embodiment, the present invention is not limited thereto. It can be understood by those skilled in the art that the operating angles may be set differently.  
      FIGS.  10  to  17  are views of a hinge device with independently operating two axes according to a second embodiment of the present invention. Referring to FIGS.  10  to  13 , a hinge device  10   b  includes a case  20   b , first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b , first and second linearly moving members  60   b  and  70   b , first and second resilient members  98   b  and  99   b , first and second supporting plates  110   b  and  120   b , and a case cover  24   b.    
      The configuration of the case  20   b  is similar to that of the case  20  of the first embodiment except that the first chamber  26   b  is provided with an upright separation wall  29   b  that connects a supporting wall  25   b  to a first end wall  21   b . The first chamber  26   b  is divided into two halves, i.e. a first sub-chamber  261   b  and a second sub-chamber  262   b , by means of separation wall  29   b . The first sub-chamber  261   b  contains the first rotating member  30   b , the first linearly moving member  60   b , the first resilient member  98   b  and the first supporting plate  110   b , which will be described later. The second sub-chamber  262   b  contains the second rotating member  40   b , the second linearly moving member  70   b , the second resilient member  99   b  and the second supporting plate  120   b , which will be described later. The first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  rotate about first and second rotation axes  105  and  110 , respectively.  
      The first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  take the shape of elongated posts extending between the first end wall  21   b  and the supporting wall  25   b  within the first and second sub-chambers  261   b  and  262   b , respectively. The first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  include base portions  32   b  and  42   b , coupling portions  34   b  and  44   b , cam follower portions, and extension rods  38   b  and  48   b , respectively. Since the rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  have the same configuration as each other, only the first rotating member  30   b  will be described in detail below. The base portion  32   b  is in the form of a disk of which one end surface faces to the first end wall  21   b  of the first sub-chamber  261   b  of the case  20   b . The coupling portion  34   b  is in the form of a rectangular rod and extends from the base portion  32   b  so that it can protrudes outside of the case  20   b  through a through-hole  211   b  of the first end wall  21   b . Although not specifically shown in the figures, the coupling portions  34   b  and  44   b  of the first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  are engaged with the coupling holes provided in the first unit (designated by reference numeral  7  in  FIG. 1 ) and the second unit (designated by reference numeral  9  in  FIG. 1 ) of the portable radiotelephone (designated by reference numeral  5  in  FIG. 1 ) and rotate along with the first and second units, respectively. The extension rod  38   b  extends from the base portion  32   b  to the supporting wall  25   b  of the case  20   b  so that a distal end of the extension rod can be fitted into a passage  251   b . The cam follower portion is provided with two cam follower protrusions  36   b  placed at an interval of 180 degrees. The two cam follower protrusions  36   b  protrude from the base portion  32   b  at both lateral sides of the extension rods  38   b.    
      Through-holes  62   b  and  72   b  are formed at the centers of the first and second linearly moving members  60   b  and  70   b , respectively. The extension rods  38   b  and  48   b  of the first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  are fitted into the through-holes  62   b  and  72   b . The first and second linearly moving members  60   b  and  70   b  have cam portions  64   b  and  74   b  formed at surfaces thereof facing the cam follower protrusions  36   b  and  46   b  of the first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b , respectively. The cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member  30   b  cooperates with the cam portion  64   b  of the first linearly moving member  60   b , while the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member  40   b  cooperates with the cam portion  74   b  of the second linearly moving member  70   b . Cam profiles of the cam portions  64   b  and  74   b  of the first and second linearly moving members  60   b  and  70   b  are partially shown in  FIGS. 15   a  and  15   b , respectively.  
      Referring to  FIGS. 15   a  and  15   b , the cam portion  64   b  of the first linearly moving member sequentially includes a fixing groove  641   b  (which is a groove relatively deeper than a stopper groove to be described later), a first horizontal surface  642   b , a first stopper groove  643   b , a second horizontal surface  644   b , and a second stopper groove  645   b . Outer sides of the fixing and stopper grooves  641   b  and  645   b  are blocked with high walls so that the cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member cannot proceed further. The cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member moves between the fixing groove  641   b  and the second stopper groove  645   b . The portion of the cam profile shown in  FIG. 15   a  is repeatedly placed at an interval of 180 degrees on the first linearly moving member.  
      Referring to  FIG. 15   b , the cam portion  74   b  of the second linearly moving member sequentially includes an upward slant surface  741   b , a horizontal surface  742   b , and a fixing groove  743   b . The fixing groove  743   b  is deeper than the first and second stopper grooves  642   b  and  643   b  provided at the cam portion  64   b  of the first linearly moving member. A high wall is placed next to the fixing groove  743   b  so that the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member cannot proceed further. The cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member moves between a location (position C 4 ) on the upward slant surface  741   b  and the fixing groove  743   b.    
      Referring to  FIGS. 10 and 11 , the first and second resilient members  98   b  and  99   b  are fitted around the first and second extension rods  38   b  and  48   b  of the first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b , respectively. One ends of the first and second resilient members  98   b  and  99   b  are in contact with the linearly moving members  60   b  and  70   b  and the other ends are in contact with the first and second supporting plates  110   b  and  120   b  to urge the first and second linearly moving members  60   b  and  70   b  against the cam follower protrusions  36   b  and  46   b  of the first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b , respectively.  
      The first and second supporting plates  110   b  and  120   b  take the same shape as each other and are contained in the first and second sub-chambers  261   b  and  262   b  of the case  20   b  to be in contact with the supporting wall  25   b , respectively. The first and second supporting plates  110   b  and  120   b  are in contact with the other ends of the first and second resilient members  98   b  and  99   b , respectively. The two supporting plates  110   b  and  120   b  are provided with passages  111   b  and  112   b , respectively, so that the first and second extension rods  38   b  and  48   b  of the first and second rotating members  30   b  and  40   b  can pass therethrough. The supporting plates  110   b  and  120   b  facilitate assembly works by beforehand compressing the resilient members  98   b  and  99   b . It can be understood by those skilled in the art that the supporting plates may be omitted, if necessary.  
       FIG. 16  shows the corresponding positions of the second unit  9  of the portable radiotelephone  5  when the cam follower protrusions  36   b  and  46   b  are located at positions C 1 , C 2 , C 3 , C 4 , C 5  and C 6  on the first and second cam portions  64   b  and  74   b  of the first and second linearly moving members shown in  FIG. 15 , respectively. Referring to  FIGS. 15 and 16 , position P 1  corresponds to a state where the second member  9  is at a fully folded position of the radiotelephone. At this time, the cam follower protrusions  36   b  and  46   b  of the first and second rotating members are located at positions C 1  and C 4 , respectively. When the second unit  9  of the portable radiotelephone  5  is moved to an unfolded position of the portable radiotelephone in such a state, the cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member is engaged in the fixing groove  641   b  and does not move, whereas the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member rides upward on the upward slant surface  741   b . When the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member is located at position C 5 , the second unit  9  is located at position P 2  in  FIG. 16 . When the second unit  9  is further moved away from the first unit, the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member moves to position C 6  while the cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member remains engaged. This state corresponds to a state where the second unit  9  is located at position P 3  in  FIG. 16 . When the second unit  9  of the portable radiotelephone  5  is further moved away from the first unit in such a state, the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member cannot proceed further, whereas the cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member escapes from the fixing groove  641   b  and moves to position C 2 . This state corresponds to a state where the second unit  9  is located at position P 4  in  FIG. 16 . When the second unit  9  of the portable radiotelephone  5  is further moved away from the first unit in such a state, the cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member moves to and is engaged at position C 3 . This state corresponds to a state where the second unit  9  is located at position P 5  and is at an unfolded position at 180 degrees in  FIG. 16 . When the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member is located on the horizontal surface  742   b  of the cam portion  74   b  of the second linearly moving member, or the cam follower protrusion  36   b  of the first rotating member is located on the first or second horizontal surface  642   b  or  644   b  of the cam portion  64   b  of the first linearly moving member, the second unit  9  is maintained in a stationary state at an arbitrary position.  
      When the second unit  9  is moved toward the first unit, the cooperation between the first linearly moving member  60   b  and the first rotating member  30   b  first occurs since the cam follower protrusion  46   b  of the second rotating member  40   b  has been inserted into the fixing groove  743   b . Then, cooperation between the second linearly moving member  70   b  and the second rotating member  40   b  occurs.  
      The cam portion of the second linearly moving member may have a profile shown in  FIG. 17  rather than the profile shown in  FIG. 15   b .  FIG. 14  is a perspective view of a linearly moving member having this cam profile. That is, a cam portion  74   c  of the second linearly moving member sequentially includes an upward slant surface  741   c , a downward slant surface  742   c , and a fixing groove  743   c . A high wall is placed next to the fixing groove  743   c  so that the cam follower protrusion  46   b  cannot proceed further. The cam follower protrusion  46   b  moves between a location on the upward slant surface  741   c  and the fixing groove  743   c.    
      In the above embodiments, the end wall of the case is formed with coupling portions to which the first and second units of the portable radiotelephone are coupled in a freely rotatable state. However, the present invention is not limited thereto. In the hinge device of the above embodiments, the end wall may be provided with through-holes rather than the coupling portions so that the extension rods of the first and second rotating members can pass therethrough and thus distal ends of the extension rods can be coupled to the first and second units of the portable radiotelephone.  
      FIGS.  18  to  20  are views of a hinge device according to a third embodiment of the present invention. Referring to  FIGS. 18 and 19 , a hinge device  10   c  includes a case  20   c , first and second rotating members  30   c  and  40   c , a linearly moving member  50   c , first and second resilient members  98   c  and  99   c , a supporting plate  100   c , first and second coupling rods  96   c  and  97   c , and a case cover  24   c . Compared with the case  20  shown in  FIG. 4 , the case  20   c  is the same as the case  20  in view of their configurations except that it is provided with through-holes  223  and  224  instead of the coupling stubs  221  and  222 . Coupling portions  961  and  971  of the first and second coupling rods  96   c  and  97   c  to be described later pass through the two through-holes  223  and  224  and protrude outside of the case, respectively.  
      The first and second rotating members  30   c  and  40   c  are configured to be symmetric with each other. The first and second rotating members  30   c  and  40   c  include first and second gear portions  32   c  and  42   c  with mutually engaging gears, respectively. Both sides of the first and second gear portions  32   c  and  42   c  are provided with coupling portions  34   c  and  44   c  in the form of a quadrangular rod and extension rods  38   c  and  48   c , respectively. Each of the two gear portions  32   c  and  42   c  is provided with two hemispherical protrusions  36   c  and  46   c  at an interval of 180 degrees. Distal ends of the extension rods  38   c  and  48   c  are provided with coupling grooves  381  and  481 . Distal ends of the coupling rods  96   c  and  97   c  to be described later are engaged with the coupling grooves  381  and  481 .  
      Referring to FIGS.  18  to  20 , the linearly moving member  50   c  is provided with circular tracks  52   c  along which the protrusions  36   c  and  46   c  move, and recesses  51   c  and  53   c  formed within the tracks into which the protrusion can be inserted. Each track has a pair of recesses  53   c  at right and left sides thereof and a pair of recesses  51   c  at upper and lower sides thereof. When the protrusions  36   c  and  46   c  are inserted into the pair of recesses  53   c  at the right and left sides, the two units of the portable radiotelephone are fixed in the unfolded state at 180 degrees. This state is shown in  FIGS. 18 and 19 . Those skilled in the art can understand the following. When the protrusions are inserted into the recesses  51   c  at the upper and lower sides by applying a force to one of the units to rotate one of the rotating members in a direction, the portable radiotelephone is fixed in the folded state. When the protrusions are inserted into the recesses  51   c  by rotating one of the rotating members in an opposite direction, the portable radiotelephone is fixed in an unfolded state at 360 degrees. When the protrusions  36   c  and  46   c  escape from the recesses  51   c  and  53   c , they can be maintained in a stationary state at arbitrary positions. In addition to the recesses  51   c  and  53   c  shown in  FIG. 20 , a desired number of recesses may be formed at required circumferential positions in the tracks  52   c.    
      Referring to  FIGS. 18 and 19 , the two coupling rods  96   c  and  97   c  includes the coupling portions  961  and  971  in the form of a quadrangular rod, and extensions  962  and  972 , respectively. Stopper plates  969  and  979  are provided between the coupling portions  961  and  971  and the extensions  962  and  972 , respectively, so that the coupling rods cannot escape from the through-holes  223  and  224  at the end wall of the case  20   c . Protruding end portions  963  and  973  are provided at distal ends of the extensions. The protruding end portions  963  and  973  are inserted into the coupling grooves  381  and  481  of the extension rod  38   c  and  48   c  of the rotating members  30   c  and  40   c  to allow the extension rods  38   c  and  48   c  and the coupling rods  96   c  and  97   c  to rotate together with each other. Consequently, the first and second units  7  and  9  are coupled to the coupling portions  34   a  and  44   c  of the extension rods  38   c  and  48   c  and the coupling portions  961  and  971  of the coupling rods  96   c  and  97   c , respectively. Since the other configurations are the same as the first embodiment, a detailed description thereof will be omitted. It can be understood by those skilled in the art that the hinge device of this embodiment provides a feature of a so-called “free stop type hinge” by means of the protrusions  36   c  and  46   c , the tracks  52   c  and the recesses  51   c  and  53   c  and the two units coupled to the hinge device can be moved to the unfolded position of the portable radiotelephone at 360 degrees.  
      Meanwhile, in the first and second embodiments, it has been described that the passages are formed at the both sides of the case and a connecting wires between the first and second units  7  and  9  passes through the passages. However, the present invention is not limited thereto.  
       FIG. 21  shows a hinge device according to a fourth embodiment of the present invention, with a case cover disassembled therefrom. When the hinge device of the fourth embodiment is compared with the hinge device of the third embodiment with reference to  FIGS. 18 and 21 , the hinge device of the fourth embodiment is very similar to the third embodiment shown in  FIG. 18  in view of their configurations except that a passage  225   d  is provided at a second end wall  21   d  to allow two through-holes  223   d  and  224   d  to communicate with each other and the coupling rods ( 96   c  and  97   c  in  FIG. 18 ) is not provided.  
      Referring to  FIGS. 21 and 22 , a flexible printed cable  300   d  as an electrical connection circuit wire is used between two units  7   d  and  9   d . The flexible printed cable  300   d  is constructed in such a manner that both branches thereof extend from respective ones of the units  7   d  and  9   d  toward the other units and are bent toward the hinge  10   d  to extend into the hinge  10   d  and then bent back in the original direction to meet each other. An intermediate portion  301   d  that is bent toward and extends into the hinge is inserted into the hinge through the two through-holes  223   c  and  224   c  and the passage  225   d  to be contained in a second chamber  27   d  of a case  20   d . Referring to  FIGS. 21 and 22 , one branch of the flexible printed cable  300   d  extends and is connected to the first unit  7   d  of the portable radiotelephone  5   d  and the other branch thereof extends and is connected to the second unit  9 . Since the intermediate portion  301   d  of the flexible printed cable  300   d  is contained in the second chamber  27   d  of the hinge device  10   d  so that it cannot be exposed to the outside, the flexible printed cable  300   d  can more safely connect the first and second units  7   d  and  9   d  of the portable radiotelephone  5  to each other. Although not specifically shown in figures, the first and second units  7   d  and  9   d  include coupling projections that surround the connection circuit wire and are rotatably inserted into the two through-holes  223   d  and  224   d  of the hinge device  10   d , respectively. Although not specifically shown in the figures, it can be understood by those skilled in the art from the above description that the coupling projections are constructed such that the flexible printed cable  300   d  passes through and is well contained within the coupling projections.  
      According to the hinge device of the present invention, a portable folder-type radiotelephone can be unfolded at 180 or even 360 degrees. Further, when the portable folder-type radiotelephone is unfolded by 180 degrees, the unfolded folder-type radiotelephone can take the shape of a conventional portable bar-type radiotelephone in that there is no protruding intermediate portion or staggering of two units. If such a hinge device has the components in the embodiments, it can provide a variety of operating features. Further, it can provide flexible circuit wire connection.  
      Although the hinge device of the present invention has been described by way of examples as being applied to portable radiotelephones in the embodiments, it is not limited thereto. It can be understood by those skilled in the art that the hinge device of the present invention can be applied to any apparatuses with two rotatably coupled units in addition to portable radiotelephones.  
      Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments, it can be understood by those skilled in the art that various modifications and changes can be made thereto without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention and that such modifications and changes also fall within the scope of the present invention.","1 .
