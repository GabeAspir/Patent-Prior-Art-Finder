The knee-rest economic chair is formed from a unitary construction, fastener-less assembly, wherein the chair provides an elevated posterior condition as an elevated knee rest for seated users. The chair may be assembled from a plurality of components all of which are formed from a planar blank of one material. The components have tabs and slots for joined adjacent components that results in a seat component spaced apart and elevated above a knee support component, positioned relative to each other in an elevated posterior position, wherein gravity secures the resulting tab-slot and slot-slot joints, making separate fasteners unnecessary.","Citations":"US-4340251-A,US-4593950-A,US-5186519-A,US-5275467-A,US-5605378-A,US-5803548-A,US-5992938-A,US-2002063463-A1,US-6582022-B2,US-6619749-B2,US-2009066140-A1,US-2013080286-A1,US-2018168354-A1,US-2019059594-A1,US-4340251-A,US-4593950-A,US-5186519-A,US-5275467-A,US-5605378-A,US-5803548-A,US-5992938-A,US-2002063463-A1,US-6582022-B2,US-6619749-B2,US-2009066140-A1,US-2013080286-A1,US-2018168354-A1,US-2019059594-A1"}

When the loaf-type food products are emptied from a container, the sauce or gel covers the exposed surfaces of the loaf-type food products and does not drip off or dry out. After more than six hours, the loaf-type food products still retain their original color and fresh wet appearance without any crust formation. Accordingly, the invention solves the problems associated with the rapid crusting/drying, color change, off odor, staleness and reduced visual appeal of the loaf-type food products after they have been exposed to air for long time periods.","Citations":"US-3480450-A,US-3982003-A,US-5413802-A,US-5620757-A,US-5985303-A,,,,,"}
