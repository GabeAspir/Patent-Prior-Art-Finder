{"publication_number":"US-2015185076-A1","abstract_en":"Embodiments of the present invention provide a Raman spectroscopic inspection method, comprising the steps of: measuring a Raman spectrum of an object to be inspected successively to collect a plurality of Raman spectroscopic signals; superposing the plurality of Raman spectroscopic signals to form a superposition signal; filtering out a florescence interfering signal from the superposition signal; and identifying the object to be inspected on basis of the superposition signal from which the florescence interfering signal has been filtered out. By means of the above method, a desired Raman spectroscopic signal may be acquired by removing the interference caused by a florescence signal from a Raman spectroscopic inspection signal of the object. It may inspect correctly the characteristics of the Raman spectrum of the object so as to identify the object effectively.","Citations":"US-4619528-A,US-5946090-A,US-6205354-B1,US-6281971-B1,US-7092852-B1,US-7145651-B2,US-7177022-B2,US-7271896-B2,US-7337066-B2,US-7760352-B2,US-7899650-B2,US-8547550-B2,"}
