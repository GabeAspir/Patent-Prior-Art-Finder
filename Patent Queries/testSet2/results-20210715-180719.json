    "Abstract": "An imaging device includes a light source capable of emitting multi-types of illumination light beams, an imaging unit including an imaging element driven by a rolling shutter method, a light source control unit, a frame image control unit, and an image generation unit. The frame image control unit controls the light source control unit and the imaging unit so as to obtain an output having a frame group, in which second exposure frames Exp2 and Exp4 are respectively disposed before and after a first exposure frame Exp3, as one period. The imaging signal generation unit generates an imaging signal according to illumination light using a ratio of a period from the exposure start timing of each horizontal pixel line to the switching timing of the illumination light and a period from the switching timing of the illumination light to the exposure end timing in the first and second exposure frames.",

    "Abstract": "A correction apparatus for an angle sensor includes a correction information generator for generating correction information, and a correction processing unit for performing correction processing in the course of generation of a detected angle value by an angle detector. Details of the correction processing are determined on the basis of the correction information. The correction information generator includes an error estimate generation unit and a correction information determination unit. The error estimate generation unit generates, on the basis of a first signal and a second signal, an error estimate containing a variable component that varies depending on an ideal angle estimate. The correction information determination unit determines the correction information on the basis of the error estimate.",

    "Abstract": "A back electromotive force of a rotating motor is converted into a voltage for a load by driving, in accordance with a duty cycle, at least one switching circuit that couples the back electromotive force to a load through a rectifying circuit. An error signal is generated that is a difference between the load voltage and a reference voltage. The duty cycle is controlled as a function of the error signal to cause the load voltage to approach the reference voltage.",
