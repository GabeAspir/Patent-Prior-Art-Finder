    "Abstract": "Provided is a method of searching for an app name in a user terminal. The user terminal requests a download of an app from an app storage server. The user terminal transmits a language set in the user terminal and an app name of the app to an app name processing server. The app name processing server acquires a word in the set language corresponding to the app name through a machine learning technique, and stores the acquired word in an app search database (DB) connected in the user terminal.",

    "Abstract": "The invention herein disclosed provides the display of stored information when creating a dialstring for use with mobile smartphones and other computer-enabled telephones. A software app recognizes input from the user (such as the initial digits of a phone number) that identifies the organization to be called, and accesses remotely stored representations of information about the organization along with the IVR phone tree information for that organization. The app then presents a graphical representation of all or part of the retrieved information on a display. The user can then respond to the graphical representation by providing selective inputs that cause the synthesis all or part of the dialstring needed to navigate the phone tree to the desired destination. Once a dialing option has been synthesized, the user may provide additional input that the system interprets as an instruction to open a phone call and dial the synthesized number.",

    "Abstract": "A method of determining occupancy of a vehicle along a route is determined by processing data generated by two different smartphones reported to be travelling in the same vehicle. An app executing within each smartphone. Information that has been transmitted from the two smartphones includes a unique identification of the mobile computing device and a unique identification of a person associated with the mobile computing device. Sensor data is also received, which corresponds to a local ambient environment inside the vehicle of the mobile computing device generating the data. The sensor data does not include location data or data entered by a user. The received data is used to determine if both mobile computing devices were actually present during the portions of the route, by comparing the data from each device.",

    "Abstract": "The invention relates to the field of making online payments by integrating social networks and payment networks to a seamless network. In particular, the invention leverages the information in the social network to conduct financial transactions. \n     The best mode of the invention is considered to be a social payment network app that incorporates all or most of the functions of credit cards, internet banking and money order companies by using the data and functions already available in the social network. \n     The invention provides better counterparty recognition, reduces the chance of fraud, or fraud, and provides a cheaper payment platform to consumers ( 110, 410 ) or small businesses while also reducing the administrative burden in making and paying purchases or reporting payments and/or expenses to third parties, such as the employer or tax administration.",

    "Abstract": "An electronic liquid level gauge assembly includes an electronic display located in a housing connected to a tank. The display has first and second display portions for indicating liquid level condition. A first electronic sensor senses a change in magnetic field of a magnet associated with a liquid level transducer, with magnet rotation being proportional liquid level change. A processor determines a temperature-compensated liquid level condition by correlating the liquid level signal with temperature measurement of the liquid. A temperature-compensated vapor space can also be calculated based on tank information and properties of the liquid. Signals related to the temperature-compensated liquid level and vapor space are sent to the display and wirelessly transmitted to a smart phone or the like for remotely viewing the tank information. The smart phone also includes a special app for sending information, firmware updates, and display configuration data to the electronic gauge assembly.",

    "Abstract": "The present disclosure describes methods and a wireless mobile device for selectively granting or denying mobile applications (“apps”) access to a cellular network. In various implementations, a wireless mobile device having both WiFi capability and cellular data capability receives a data packet from an app executing on the wireless mobile device. If the app is not whitelisted and the wireless mobile device is not connected to a WiFi network, the wireless mobile device drops the data packet. If, on the other hand, the app is whitelisted, the wireless mobile device transmits the data packet over the cellular network.",
