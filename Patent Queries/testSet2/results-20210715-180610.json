    "Abstract": "A control apparatus ( 80 ) for a vehicle ( 10; 100 ) having an electric motor (MG 2;  MG), and a step-variable transmission ( 20; 110 ) which is selectively placed in a plurality of speed positions with engagement of at least one of a plurality of coupling devices (CB), wherein the vehicle runs rearward with a reverse drive torque (TmR) of the electric motor generated in a forward-drive low-speed position of the transmission. The control apparatus includes: a first shift control portion ( 86 ) operated during a coasting shift-down action of the transmission to the low-speed position and configured to temporarily increase the forward drive torque (TmF) of the electric motor above its required value, for thereby temporarily increasing an input torque of the transmission to raise its input speed toward a synchronizing speed in the low-speed position. The first shift control portion commands an engaging-side coupling device, which is one of the coupling devices for the forward-drive low-speed position and which was placed in its released state before the shift-down action, to be brought into its engaged state after the input speed has been raised to a predetermined value; and a second shift control portion ( 88 ) operated when switching to rearward running of the vehicle is required during the coasting shift-down action and configured to increase an engaging force of the engaging-side coupling device, for thereby raising the input speed of the transmission toward the synchronizing speed, to bring the engaging-side coupling device into the engaged state.",

    "Abstract": "A method for fetching a target bin stored in a storage system (100), wherein the storage system includes a three-dimensional storage grid containing a plurality of bins stacked in vertical stacks, supporting rails (13) on the grid structure, and a plurality of vehicles (1), controllably arranged to move individually on the supporting rails. The method is performed by a control device in the system and comprises controlling at least one non-target vehicle to operate as intermediate storage for a bin located vertically above the target bin (5); controlling a target vehicle to pick up the target bin, and controlling the at least one non-target vehicle and the target vehicle to be positioned adjacent to each other in a linear manner on the supporting rails. A corresponding storage system has also been disclosed.",

    "Abstract": "On-board equipment in a motor vehicle includes a C-V2X communication device receiving a first signal from road side equipment having a known position. The C-V2X communication device transmits a second signal having content that is dependent upon a length of time in which the first signal traveled from the road side equipment to the C-V2X communication device. A GPS device is communicatively coupled to the C-V2X communication device and receives the second signal from the C-V2X communication device. The GPS device estimates a position of the vehicle. The estimating is dependent upon the second signal from the C-V2X communication device.",

    "Abstract": "A method of operating an access control system comprising a server ( 3 ), a control device ( 4 ) and a point of sales device ( 1 ) for access permissions to a covered area. An algorithm is installed on the point of sales device ( 1 ) which can only be executed locally if unlocked by a key transmitted by the server. If a point of sales device is not connected to the server, the algorithm is executed using the key and access permission is generated, encrypted and marked as an offline-generated access permission and encoded. If access control is carried out while the point of sales device is unconnected, the offline-generated access permission is read out by an access control device ( 4 ). Based on labelling as an offline-generated access permission, it is identified as such and the validity of the access permission is verified based on the data encoded by the point of sales device.",

    "Abstract": "Systems and apparatuses for capturing an image of a vehicle for which roadside assistance is being requested are provided. The image may be captured by a mobile device and the mobile device may geotag location information to the image. The image and associated geotag location information may then be processed to determine a location of the vehicle and a roadside assistance issue for which service is being requested. The image may be further analyzed to determine a context including, a make, model and/or year of the vehicle, whether special equipment is needed to service the vehicle, whether the vehicle is located in a particular situation (e.g., within a structure, in a ditch, or the like). The information obtained from the image may be used to determine a type of service to provide to the vehicle and to identify one or more service providers to dispatch to the vehicle.",
