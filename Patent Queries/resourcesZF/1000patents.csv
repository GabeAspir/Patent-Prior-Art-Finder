US-7295414-B2,"A power output device includes a bridged output stage, a reference voltage generator and a detecting unit to compare the output voltages from the aforementioned two units. The bridged output stage may be implemented by a full-bridge or a half-bridge configuration. The reference voltage generator is symmetric to the bridged output stage to generate a reference voltage, which is served as a reference voltage range for the voltage difference of the two terminals of the turned-on transistors in the bridged output stage during operation.

The device includes a helical spring that is seated within a fixed bushing with its outer surface in contact with an inner cylindrical surface of the bushing. When torque is applied from the manually operable source, one overlapping end of the spring is moved away from its other end to reduce the spring diameter and hence release any frictional engagement of the spring with the bushing, thus allowing the torque to rotate the spring, which rotation is transmitted to the roller. However, when no such manually applied torque is present, the spring and the roller remain effectively locked in position.

US-7006347-B1,"The present invention relates to electrolytic capacitors and, more particularly, to the reduction of water content within an electrolytic capacitor. Aluminum electrolytic capacitors tend to degrade with time. This is due, in part, to water in the electrolyte attacking the thin film of aluminum oxide (Al 2 O 3 ) formed on the anode surface. Deformation of the aluminum oxide increases the leakage current of the capacitor, such that when one or more capacitors are used for shock delivery in an ICD, the first shock (after a hiatus) will have a significantly longer charge time. Unfortunately, one cannot remove all of the water from the electrolyte, as it is needed for conduction, as well as for the formation of the cut edges of the aluminum foil after assembly. According to the present invention, a desiccant material is used within an electrolytic capacitor casing to reduce the water content of a finished capacitor to below 1% by weight of the electrolyte. In a further embodiment, a moisture barrier layer is applied over the desiccant material, such that the desiccant material slowly absorbs moisture from the electrolyte, allowing for aging of the capacitor after assembly."

US-7067456-B2,"A reaction-based process has been developed for the selective removal of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from a multicomponent gas mixture to provide a gaseous stream depleted in CO 2  compared to the inlet CO 2  concentration in the stream. The proposed process effects the separation of CO 2  from a mixture of gases (such as flue gas/fuel gas) by its reaction with metal oxides (such as calcium oxide). The Calcium based Reaction Separation for CO 2  (CaRS-CO 2 ) process consists of contacting a CO 2  laden gas with calcium oxide (CaO) in a reactor such that CaO captures the CO 2  by the formation of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ). Once “spent”, CaCO 3  is regenerated by its calcination leading to the formation of fresh CaO sorbent and the evolution of a concentrated stream of CO 2 . The “regenerated” CaO is then recycled for the further capture of more CO 2 . This carbonation-calcination cycle forms the basis of the CaRS-CO 2  process. This process also identifies the application of a mesoporous CaCO 3  structure, developed by a process detailed elsewhere, that attains &gt;90% conversion over multiple carbonation and calcination cycles.
