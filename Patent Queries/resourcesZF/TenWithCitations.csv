US-2019028637-A1,"Systems, devices, media, and methods are presented for object modeling using augmented reality. An object modeling mode for generating three-dimensional models of objects is initiated by one or more processors of a device. The processors of the device detect an object within a field of view. Based on a position of the object, the processors select a set of movements forming a path for the device relative to the object and cause presentation of at least one of the movements. The processors detect a set of object surfaces as portions of the object are positioned in the field of view. In response to detecting at least a portion of the object surface, the processors modify a graphical depiction of a portion of the object. The processors then construct a three-dimensional model of the object from the set of images, depth measurements, and IMU readings collected during the reconstruction process.","US-2011227924-A1,US-8059889-B2,US-2012281873-A1,US-8416236-B1,US-2013136341-A1,US-2013342533-A1,US-8818081-B1,US-8849620-B2,US-9094670-B1,US-2011227924-A1,US-8059889-B2,US-2012281873-A1,US-8416236-B1,US-2013136341-A1,US-2013342533-A1,US-8818081-B1,US-8849620-B2,US-9094670-B1"
US-2019251947-A1,"A digital circuit arrangement for an ambient noise-reduction system affording a higher degree of noise reduction than has hitherto been possible. The arrangement converts the analog signals into N-bit digital signals at sample rate f 0 , and then subjects the converted signals to digital filtering. The value of N in some embodiments is 1 but, in any event, is no greater than 8, and f 0  may be 64 times the Nyquist sampling rate but, in any event, is substantially greater than the Nyquist sampling rate. This permits digital processing to be used without incurring group delay problems that rule out the use of conventional digital processing in this context. Furthermore, adjustment of the group delay can readily be achieved, in units of a fraction of a micro-second, providing the ability to fine tune the group delay for feed forward applications.","US-5157395-A,US-2004223553-A1"
