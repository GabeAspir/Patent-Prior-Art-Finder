US-7636639-B2,"A remote sensor and associated data processor, performs concurrent analysis of backscattered signals from a multi-beam ( 6 - 10 ) acoustic Doppler emitter/receiver ( 1 ) positioned against the inside wall of a conveying pipe ( 2 ) or channel. Range-gating of the return signals allows independent analysis of discrete volumes of backscattered signal data corresponding to the distribution, concentration and travel velocity of small individual volumes or bins of water and suspended solids ( 4 ). Velocity is derived from the measured Doppler frequency shift for each bin. Relative solids concentration is estimated as a function of the measured intensity of the backscattered signals. The intensity data are calibrated by inputting site-specific environmental information, such as temperature, salinity, acoustical system constant, backscattered signal interpretation ratio between concentration and particle size, and concurrently measured concentration values obtained from physical sample collection and previous laboratory analysis into the analytical computer program. The program uses redundant iterative routines that adjust calibration parameters using data obtained from the previous measurement on an adjacent layer in a continuous self-correcting process. The apparatus and method provide both historical and real-time measurements of distribution, concentration and velocity of suspended solids in a flow of piped or channeled liquid ( 3 ).","FIELD OF THE INVENTION 
   This invention relates to measurement of water quality, and more specifically to instruments used for measuring the concentration of suspended solids in a liquid flowing through a conduit. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   The safe disposal of sewer effluents and water treatment requires measurements of suspended solid concentration in treatment pipes, culverts and other conduits. 
   A sewer effluent containing a low value of suspended solid may be subject to a reduced treatment or no treatment at all. A plant treating sewer effluents from several municipalities may bill those municipalities in accordance with the volume flow and the total suspended solid concentration measured on the intake conduits from each municipality. 
   In the past, intrusive periodical samplings of solid-carrying water were taken and analyzed in laboratories to provide needed information about the solid contents of the water. 
   Various methods have been proposed to electronically measure total solid concentration in a volume of liquid, but no instrumentation has been provided for concurrently measuring suspended solid concentration as well as flow on a continuous, real time base. 
   This invention results from an attempt to provide a more practical instrumentation for use in sewer and water treatment plants. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   The principal and secondary objects of this invention are to provide a non-intrusive method and apparatus for continuously measuring the total solid concentration in a liquid flowing through a pipe as well as the speed of various layers of flow within that pipe. 
   This and other valuable objects are achieved by placing an acoustical transmitter on the inside wall of a pipe or other conduit. The transmitter emits two pairs of obliquely divergent beams, one beam of each pair is aimed downstream from the other one in the pair. Echo signals of the emitted waveform are chopped into samplings corresponding to discrete volumes or pockets of the liquid in the pipe distributed along each beam. Doppler frequency shifts received from the beams are interpreted into velocity measurements of the solids within a number of flow layers within the pipe. The intensity of the backscattered echo signals are translated into solid concentration values using simplified algorithms combined with redundant iterative routines that adjust calibration parameters using data obtained from previous measurement on an adjacent layer in a continuous self-correcting process.

   DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION 
   Referring now to the drawing, there is shown in  FIGS. 1-3 , a suspended solid velocity and concentration transducer  1  installed at the bottom of a pipe  2  carrying sewage water  3  containing suspended solids  4  and flowing in the direction indicated by the arrow  5  in  FIG. 1 . Piezoelectric ceramics in the transducer emit an acoustical waveform consisting of short pulses along four narrow beams  6 ,  7 ,  8 ,  9  pointing in different directions. The beams are grouped into two pairs in which a first beam  6 ,  8  is angled upstream at an angle L 6 cf of about 20 degrees from the vertical, and the second beam  7 ,  9  in each pair is slanted downstream a the same angle as the first beam. As more specifically shown in  FIG. 2 , the planes of each pair of beams are aimed at a transversal angle L 6 wf,L 8 wf from the vertical and from the other pair of beams. Echo signals of the pulses are backscattered from the suspended solids  4 . Since these solids have motion relative to the transducer, the echo signals are Doppler-shifted in frequency. A fifth ceramic transducer  10  mounted in the center of the transducer and aimed vertically is used to measure the depth of flow. As illustrated in  FIGS. 4 and 5 , the system includes an electronic processing unit  11  that receives an input signal RCVS-SIG from the transducer  1  and converts it into digital data D-OUT that is fed to a data processor  12 . The system divides the echo signals into discrete regular intervals for samplings that correspond to different, discrete volumes of the flowing liquid. Velocity is calculated from the frequency shift measured in each sampling. The result is a profile of linear distribution of velocity along the beams illustrated by velocity profile lines  13  in FIG.  2 . Each of the small divisions  14  shown along beam  9  of  FIG. 2  represent an individual velocity measurement in a discrete volume known as a depth cell or bin. The velocity profile lines  13  are generated from velocity data measured by the upstream and downstream beam of each pair. The data from one beam pair are averaged to generate the profile lines. 
   Since Doppler measurements are directional, only the component of velocity along the direction of transmit and receive is measured. Narrow acoustic beams are used to accurately determine the horizontal velocity of the flow. The accuracy of the measurement is also enhanced by using gating times for the samplings that correspond to small volumes of approximately 5 centimeters in length and diameter. Potential bias in the return energy spectrum due to range dependent variables is avoided. The result is a very precise measurement of the vertical and transversal distribution of flow velocities. The velocity data from the two pairs of beams are entered into an algorithm to determine a mathematical description of the flow velocities throughout the entire cross-section of the liquid. The algorithm fits the basic functions of a parametric model to the actual data. The results predicts flow velocity at all points throughout the liquid. These results are integrated over the cross-sectional area to determine the discharge. The key benefit of this approach is that the system will operate accurately under different hydraulic conditions. As hydraulic conditions change, the change will manifest itself in the distribution of velocity throughout the depth of flow. As the system is measuring the velocity distribution directly, it will adapt to the changes in hydraulics, and generate a flow pattern that is representative of the new hydraulic conditions, insuring an accurate estimate of the flow rate. The measurement of distribution and concentration of the suspended solids  4  stem from a requirement of the frequency measurement circuits within the electronic processing unit  11  to receive a near-constant input voltage. An acoustic pulse emitted from the transducer  1  has a certain initial intensity that progressively diminishes as it travels through the liquid and is scattered from suspended particles. The reflected energy detected by the transducer is a very small fraction of that which was emitted. In addition, the return intensity of the backscattered vary considerably according to, but not limited to, the range to the point of energy reflection, the concentration of reflecting particles, and the water temperature. The received weakened signal RCV-SIG passes through an amplifier RCV-AMP that brings it to the level required by the frequency measurement circuits. A large loss of signal strength requires a large degree of amplification. The degree of amplification which is required is thus a measure of the loss of signal strength and, inversely, a measure of the intensity of the backscatter. The amount of amplification required is provided by the Receive Signal Strength Indicator RSSI. It is this measurement which facilitates the estimation of suspended solid concentration in the water column. In other words, the intensity value of the backscattered signal is translated into concentration values of the suspended solids and the frequency shifts of the receive signal is interpreted as an indication of velocity of solids in the flow of liquid. 
   As shown in  FIG. 5 , the transducer output signal RCV-SIG is routed to a receive coupling transformer RCV-XFMR that provides isolation and impedance matching. The signal is further amplified and bandwidth limited by the high gain selective log amplifier RCV-AMP. The amplified receive signal is fed to a pair of frequency mixers FMIX, where the signal is mixed replicatively with the local oscillator signal frequency LO. The desired base band signal, which is the difference frequency of the receive signal and the local oscillator frequency, is obtained by passing the mixer output signals through a pair of low pass filters LPF. The base band signals contain now the entire Doppler spectrum without the carrier signal. The mixers, are quadrature mixers, where an in-phase and a quadrature signal are obtained. Both signals are needed for the correlator CORR, which performs the basic digital signal processing. The in-phase and quadrature signals are buffered by a pair of first-in/first-out buffers FIFO and become part of the data D-OUT output to the data processor  12 . The echo signals are also fed to a low-pass filter RSSI-LPF, then to a buffer RSSI-BUFF and digitized by an analog-to-digital converter RSSI-ADC. Finally, they are fed to the data processor as part of the output signal D-OUT. 
   A timing generator TMG-GEN generates all signals needed for the transmitter and receiver, such as the transmit signals, transmit enable, and the local oscillator quadrature signal for the mixer. The frequency of the pulses emitted by the transducer is 1.2288 MHz. A transmitter amplifier XMT-AMP acts as a power driver which buffers the logic level signal generated by the timing generator, and drives a transmitter output transformer XMT-XFMR, the transmit transformer also provides isolation between the electronic processing unit and the transducer. 
   The transmit current is monitored by a current transformer CURR-XFMR. Its output signal is scaled and digitized by an analog-to-digital converter CURR-ADC and is used as part ofa built-in self-test by the data processor. All timing generator setups are fully programmable, and are down-loaded by the data processor to the timing generator&#39;s on an internal RAM. 
   The data processor is able to read back, the timing setup data and the digitized current sensed data. 
   The transducer illustrated in  FIG. 6  includes a signal transmit and receive multiplexer controlled by the electronic processing unit. The transmit signal generated by the timing generator TMG-GEN of the electronic processing unit passes through a coupling transformer XFMR which provides isolation and impedance matching. The signal is then multiplexed to one of the five beams by a selectable transmit/receive switch TJR-SW 6 -TJR-SW 10 . At the end of the transmitting phase, the multiplexer is deselected. As the echo signal is received from the Piezoelectric ceramics P- 6  through P- 10 , it passes through the switch and one of the selected band pass filters BPF- 6  through BPF- 10  then to a preamplifier PA- 6  through PA- 10  and is converted to a differential signal by a wide band signal transformer XFMR before being fed to the electronic control unit. A thermistor T-SENSE is used to measure the transducer&#39;s ambient temperature. The temperature signal is scaled and buffered by an amplifier S-AMP, digitized by the transducer control XDCR-CTL and fed to the electronic control unit. 
   The following simplified formula of the acoustic theory governing backscatter from particles suspended in the water column identifies the main factors that contribute to the determination of suspended solids concentration from the intensity data.
 
 E=SL+SV= Constant−20 log( R )−2α w   R   (Equation 1)
 
   where:
         E=echo intensity,   SL=transmitted power,   SV=backscatter intensity due to the particles suspended in the water column,   α w =a coefficient describing the absorption of energy by the water,   R=the distance from the transducer to the measurement bin.       

   The echo intensity E measured by the system is a relative intensity, coming from direct measurement of the pressure amplitude of the return signal. Although the system will clearly recognize variations of echo intensity, it cannot determine the exact amount of backscatter intensity that is due solely to the presence of solids. Other factors that contribute to the final intensity must be removed. 
   The term 20 log(R) is a simple geometric function to account for the spherical spreading of the beam. This term can be further refined to include a near-field correction to the assumption of spherical spreading. Accurate knowledge of the velocity of sound is essential for determination of the range to a given measurement bin. The system computes a range based on the measured time and a sound velocity. Sound velocity is computed by using a user-defined salinity (assumed to be 0 for the sewer environment) and the temperature measured at the sensor head. This speed of sound is assumed by the method described here to be constant throughout the water column. This is a safe assumption in sewer environments as the depth of the flow is limited and the flow is well mixed. 
   It is not possible to make direct comparisons between the measurements made by different instruments unless the instruments have been calibrated in the field or the laboratory to establish their performance characteristics. The terms SL and Constant account for these differences and also deal with the characteristics of the suspended load. Understanding the manner in which instrument performance characteristics affect the data and correcting for these differences through field calibrations is key to the measurement method. This method makes use of the measured relative backscattered intensities and uses site-specific calibrations to compensate for such variations and determine a concentration of suspended solids. 
   The final two terms α w , and SV, refer to the absorption of acoustic energy by the water and the relative backscatter intensity. Acoustic energy is absorbed by water as it passes through it, and α w , is a measure of the amount of energy lost in this process. SV is the term we are interested in—the amount of energy that is backscattered by the presence of solids in the water column. An increase or decrease in the amount of solids will affect the value of SV. An additional term not included in Equation 1 must also be accounted for. This term describes the attenuation of the acoustic signal due to scattering and absorption by the suspended load. 
   To actually derive the mass concentration of total suspended solids TSS in the water from the measured intensity, one must determine the true backscattered sound intensity due to the presence of the solids. It can be shown that the relationship between the two parameters is as follows:

   where:
         M(r)=echo intensity,   K=transmitted power,   P rms =backscatter intensity due to the particles suspended in the water column,   α s =particle radius   ρ s =particle density   α w =a coefficient describing the absorption of energy by the water,   α s =a coefficient describing the absorption of energy by the water.       

   In this equation, the expected mass concentration, M(r) is a function of the sediment attenuation coefficient α s , which defines how the presence of solids attenuates the return signal. Both of these parameters are unknown. To provide a solution to this, it is necessary to use a numerical method. Computation of the mass concentration is performed without using a value of α s . The resulting value of M(r) is used to compute a value for α s . This computation process is iterated in the bin nearest to the sensor to derive final values of both sediment attenuation and mass concentration. This method is then applied in a step-wise manner along the successive bins of the profile. 
   The method proposed here to allow for the measurement of solids concentration on site, accomplishes this by using a simplified version of the above-expression:
 
Log 10   M ( r )= K   s   +S[dB+ 2 r (α w +α s )]  (Equation 3)
 
   dB is now the measured relative backscatter intensity, corrected for spherical spreading and any applicable near field effects. S is the relative backscatter coefficient that defines the relationship between solids concentration and particle size. K s  is the site and instrument constant that corrects for the individual characteristics of a specific instrument at a given site. The other terms are as in Equation 2 and represent intensity attenuation by the presence of solids (α s ) and water absorption (α w ). 
   The amount of sound energy which is lost, or attenuated, due to the absorption by water has been found to depend on the frequency of the sound waves (i.e., of the instrument), and the salinity and the temperature of the water as follows:

   where: T is the water temperature in degrees Celsius. 
   Using these formulae, the attenuation of the signal due to water absorption, per meter, may be computed and hence, using the slant length of the bin, the total attenuation of sound through each measurement interval, or “bin”, can be derived. 
   When sound passing through the water column strikes particles of suspended solids, the energy is attenuated both by scattering and absorption by the solid media. The degree of scattering depends on the relationship between the frequency and the size of the particle. Frequency may be expressed in terms of the Wave Number, k, where:

   When the value of the product kα s  (where α s  is the particle radius) is well below 0.5, Rayleigh scattering occurs. This is the range normally found during suspended sediment measuring conditions. The sediment constant, ζ 1 , is given by:

   where:
         ρ s =the density of the sediment in kg/m 3      K α =a term relating to compressibility and density (normal value 0.18)       

   The actual sediment attenuation per meter due to scattering, α 1  (Nepers/m), by the solids in a region at range, r, and with a mass concentration of M r  (kg/m 3 ) is then given by:
 
α 1   =M   r×ζ 1  (Equation 8)
 
   Acoustic energy is also absorbed by sediment in the water column. The following expression (Urick, 1948) is used to determine the sediment attenuation per meter due to this absorption, α 2  (Nepers/m):

   where:
         ρ s =the density of the solid particles   ρw=the density of the water   ν w =the kinematic viscosity of the water.       

   The above-expressions are valid for values of the product kα s , being much less than unity. This is the region where attenuation due to scattering becomes negligible and viscous absorption begins to dominate. 
   The method combines the attenuation due to scattering and absorption into a single Sediment Attenuation Conefficient SAC. The SAC can either be defined by the user or can be computed by the processing software using a nominal, or “effective”, particle size in combination with assumed values for particle specific gravity (2.7) and compressibility (0.18). In both cases, the input values are inevitably estimates and must be refined by iteration within the software&#39;s Calibration Module. 
   It is almost impossible, in practice, to calculate from first principles the sediment attenuation coefficient for a natural population of sediment. The approach used in the software is a pragmatic approach in which workable values of the coefficient are established using actual observational data. It therefore, becomes somewhat academic as to whether or not the input values of, for example, particle size and compressibility are correct. 
   The computer program CP controlling the data processor carries out all of the computations required to derive sediment concentrations from measured backscatter intensity, according to the simplified Equation 3 and a value for sediment attenuation derived by calibration. The program imports the backscatter data (expressed in instrument counts) and ancillary information (e.g., temperature, salinity, etc.) from raw system data files. The user may either input specific site calibrations values (e.g., values for S and Ks) on the keyboard or have the program determine these values from entered data. The user also input values for TSS that were measured by taking samples of water and having them analyzed by a laboratory for TSS values. These sample are taken concurrently with the system data so that a direct calibration between system-measured values and actual values can be determined. 
   The program then takes the raw measured data from the first valid measurement bin below each transducer. It calculates the various required parameters and solves Equation 3, using the iterative routine, to find the suspended sediment concentration in the first whole bin and in the interval between the transducers and the first bin (where the system cannot obtain data). The computed solids concentrations and sediment attenuation are then fed into the system again in order to make the relevant corrections in the next bin, which is then solved using a similar iterative process. The procedure is repeated until the last whole bin has been solved. The software then moves on to the next ensemble of data. 
   Following this, the program displays the calculated concentrations and compares them to the actual measured concentrations. Errors between the two data sets, calculated then actual, are also displayed as functions of depth and concentration. The user then adjusts the different parameters (S, Ks, and the SAC) to improve the correlation between data sets. As this is an iterative process, and some parameters are initially given seed values, the user adjusts the parameters to increase the correlation between the two data sets and reduce the errors to zero, while observing the results of their actions in real-time. 
   The method can be utilized in the sanitary sewer environment, and can provide both historical and real-time measurement of TSS in addition to flow measurement. This will allow users to measure total mass transport of solids within sanitary sewer systems as well as the volume transport of water. The method described here uses data from multiple beams to accomplish this. The method has the ability to look at the spatial distribution of solids concentration in the depth of flow as well as total solids concentration.","1.

US-7657924-B2,"A method, system and computer program product for implementing authorization policies for web services may include defining an authorization policy for access to a web service. The method, system and computer program product may also include attaching the authorization policy to a service definition for the web service.","BACKGROUND OF INVENTION 
     The present invention relates to web services or services provided over a network, such as the Internet or private network, and more particularly to a method and system for implementing authorization policies for web services. 
     Controlling access to services, such as web services or the like, offered via the Internet, private network or similar network to only authorized users may present challenges. This may be particularly challenging in the circumstance where a single Universal Resource Locator (URL) offers different services to multiple different groups of authorized users. In a Simple Object Process Protocol/HyperText Transfer Protocol (SOAP/HTTP) the URL corresponding to the HTTP binding may be protected. This may be appropriate protection where the URL only offers the web service to be protected but may not be sufficient in the case described above where multiple restricted access web services may be handled under the same URL. 
     The web service may be protected closer to the service implementation; for example, the Sun Microsystems™ Enterprise JavaBeans™ code utilized in association with a Java 2 Enterprise Edition (J2EE®) model may be protected using J2EE access security. Java, Enterprise JavaBeans and Sun Microsystems are trademarks of Sun Microsystems, Inc. in the United States, other countries or both. One issue with this type of security arrangement is that performing access control may be difficult when a gateway, proxy server or the like is involved. There may be various layers that may be able to perform access control which need to be handled consistently across the various layers.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     The following detailed description of embodiments refers to the accompanying drawings, which illustrate specific embodiments of the invention. Other embodiments having different structures and operations do not depart from the scope of the present invention. 
     As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the present invention may be embodied as a method, system, or computer program product. Accordingly, the present invention may take the form of an entirely hardware embodiment, an entirely software embodiment (including firmware, resident software, micro-code, etc.) or an embodiment combining software and hardware aspects that may all generally be referred to herein as a “circuit,” “module” or “system.” Furthermore, the present invention may take the form of a computer program product on a computer-usable storage medium having computer-usable program code embodied in the medium. 
     Any suitable computer readable medium may be utilized. The computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be, for example but not limited to, an electronic, magnetic, optical, electromagnetic, infrared, or semiconductor system, apparatus, device, or propagation medium. More specific examples (a non-exhaustive list) of the computer-readable medium would include the following: an electrical connection having one or more wires, a portable computer diskette, a hard disk, a random access memory (RAM), a read-only memory (ROM), an erasable programmable read-only memory (EPROM or Flash memory), an optical fiber, a portable compact disc read-only memory (CD-ROM), an optical storage device, a transmission media such as those supporting the Internet or an intranet, or a magnetic storage device. Note that the computer-usable or computer-readable medium could even be paper or another suitable medium upon which the program is printed, as the program can be electronically captured, via, for instance, optical scanning of the paper or other medium, then compiled, interpreted, or otherwise processed in a suitable manner, if necessary, and then stored in a computer memory. In the context of this document, a computer-usable or computer-readable medium may be any medium that can contain, store, communicate, propagate, or transport the program for use by or in connection with the instruction execution system, apparatus, or device. 
     Computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may be written in an object oriented programming language such as Java, Smalltalk, C++ or the like. However, the computer program code for carrying out operations of the present invention may also be written in conventional procedural programming languages, such as the “C” programming language or similar programming languages. The program code may execute entirely on the user&#39;s computer, partly on the user&#39;s computer, as a stand-alone software package, partly on the user&#39;s computer and partly on a remote computer or entirely on the remote computer or server. In the latter scenario, the remote computer may be connected to the user&#39;s computer through a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN), or the connection may be made to an external computer (for example, through the Internet using an Internet Service Provider). 
     The present invention is described below with reference to flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams of methods, apparatus (systems) and computer program products according to embodiments of the invention. It will be understood that each block of the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, and combinations of blocks in the flowchart illustrations and/or block diagrams, can be implemented by computer program instructions. These computer program instructions may be provided to a processor of a general purpose computer, special purpose computer, or other programmable data processing apparatus to produce a machine, such that the instructions, which execute via the processor of the computer or other programmable data processing apparatus, create means for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. 
     These computer program instructions may also be stored in a computer-readable memory that can direct a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to function in a particular manner, such that the instructions stored in the computer-readable memory produce an article of manufacture including instruction means which implement the function/act specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. 
     The computer program instructions may also be loaded onto a computer or other programmable data processing apparatus to cause a series of operational steps to be performed on the computer or other programmable apparatus to produce a computer implemented process such that the instructions which execute on the computer or other programmable apparatus provide steps for implementing the functions/acts specified in the flowchart and/or block diagram block or blocks. 
       FIG. 1  is a flow chart of an example of a method  100  for implementing an authorization policy for web services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. In block  102 , an authorization policy for access to a web service or the like may be defined. The authorization policy definition may be based on a service definition or the like. For instance, the authorization policy may be based on the concrete binding (e.g., URL), or operation defined in its port type, or other service definition elements that may be part of the WSDL definition or artifacts associated with WSDL, such as properties, metadata, etc. In block  104 , the authorization policy may be attached to a service definition in terms of a policy description. In block  106 , each operation on a port type may be protected at an abstraction level in terms of roles or based on a role required by the user. For example, an operation that may be called ‘viewItinerary’ on a travel service web site can be defined in terms of a ‘TravelAgent’ role so that the definition is abstract in terms of what makes up the permission. During deployment and based on the environment, further configuration can be done so that, the TravelAgent role may be assigned to an AgentGroup in a Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) directory in a given travel agency. 
       FIG. 2  is a flow chart of an example of a method  200  for implementing an authorization policy for web services in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In block  202 , a web service may be deployed consisting of a web service description language (WSDL) definition. In block  206 , an authorization policy document or definition may be specified for access to WSDL messages, WSDL port types or the like. The authorization document or definition may provide flexibility in controlling access to message parts, web services or the like for fine grained access control, if needed. In block  206 , the authorization policy definition may be attached to port types, operations, messages or the like.  FIG. 3  is an example of a program or computer executable code  300  in WSDL for attaching a policy to a port type in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. 
     To perform method level control of access to a WSDL service, policy document (acct-authz-policy.xml), the XML can have finer grained definitions. The authorization policy in that case, may refer to elements within a message, protocol or the like, so that the granularity is not only at the operation level but can be based on a given message or context during service invocation (e.g., time of the day, whether the service requestor is on a mobile device, in a secure location, or the like. To perform access control on the message itself, the message would refer to the policy documents. The references can end up pointing to authorization policy definitions.  FIG. 4  is an example of a program or computer executable code  400  in WSDL of an authorization policy file to define roles for different named individuals in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. Such definitions can be attached to either port types, operations, messages or the like depending upon the level of granularity or control required. 
       FIG. 5  is flow chart of an example of a method  500  for implementing an authorization policy for web services in accordance with another embodiment of the present invention. In block  502 , a gateway server may receive a request for services. The web server may be a web services gateway, proxy server or the like. The request for services may be to perform a task, a transaction, to provide information or data or the similar operation. In block  504 , the gateway server may inspect the request. The gateway server may inspect the request to determine if the request or the requester or user requires authorization in order to access the web services required to fulfill the request or the gateway server may inspect the request for other purposes. 
     In block  506 , the gateway server may review an authorization policy document or definition. As previously discussed, the authorization policy document or definition may be attached to or associated with a port type, an operation, a message or the like associated with the request. In block  508 , a determination may be made whether the request or access to the web services to fulfill the request is protected or access is limited to certain users. If the request or access to the web services is not protected or limited, the method  500  may advance to block  510 . In block  510 , the request may be dispatched to an appropriate application server to fulfill the request. The method  500  may then end at termination  522 . 
     If the request or access to the web services is protected in block  508 , the method  500  may advance to block  512 . In block  512 , the identity of the user may be authenticated and verified to insure that the user is authorized to access the web services needed to fulfill the request. In block  514 , a determination may be made whether the user is authorized to make the request from block  512 . If the user in not authorized to make the request, the method may advance to block  516 . In block  516 , a message may be sent to the user that in effect indicates that the user is not an authorized user and cannot access the web services to fulfill the request. The method  500  may then end at termination  522 . 
     If the user is an authorized user in block  514 , the method  500  may advance to block  518 . In block  518 , the user may be granted the required role to access the web services for fulfilling the request and the request may be dispatched to the appropriate application server to satisfy the request. 
     In block  520 , the request or message may be inspected again and authorization to the web service may be enforced in the application server based on the policy documents or definitions that may be accessed by the application server. Once a request is handled at a SOAP level, the request may be dispatched to an implementation level and the request may be fulfilled and results returned to the user. 
       FIG. 6  is an exemplary system  600  for implementing an authorization policy for web services in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention. The system  600  may include one or more gateway servers, such as a reverse proxy server  602  and a web services gateway  604  or similar servers. The reverse proxy server  602  may be accessed by users  606  using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or similar protocols. The web services gateway server  604  may be accessed by users  608  using SOAP/HTTP type protocols or the like and by users  610  that may utilize SOAP/Java Messaging Service (JMS) or similar protocols or services. A firewall  612  may be disposed between the users or clients  606 - 610  and the reverse proxy server  602  and web services gateway  604 . 
     The reverse proxy server  602  and the web services gateway  604  may access authorization policies  614 . As previously discussed, the authorization policies  616  may be WSDL definitions, authorization documents or the like. Examples of authorization policies may include Acct-authz-policy.xml, role based authz, and the like, and may be applicable to Enterprise JavaBeans®, .NET applications and similar applications. The reverse proxy server  602  or web services gateway  604  may review the appropriate authorization policy related to a request in response to receiving the request. The server  602  or gateway  604  may authenticate the user  606 - 610  making the request and verify the identity of the requesting user in response to the request being protected based on review of the authorization policy  614 . The user  606 - 610  may be granted a required role for the request and the request may be dispatched to an application server  616  in response to the user  606 - 610  being authorized to make the request. 
     The application server  616  may provide a variety of functions. The application server  616  may serve as a central hub for running services such as message routing, object exchange, transaction processing, data transformation or other data processing functions. The application server  616  may also provide secure access to other servers, databases, networks or the like. The application server  616  may be an IBM WebSphere®, .NET or similar type application server or the like. WebSphere® is a registered trademark of the IBM Corporation in the United States, other countries or both. The application server  616  may receive requests dispatched from the reverse proxy server  602  or web services gateway  604  in response to the user  606 - 610  being authorized to make the request based on the authorization policies  614  for the web services being requested. The application server  616  may access the authorization policies  614  that may reside in a database or data source  618  that may be remote from the application server  616 . The application server  616  may enforce authorization to utilize the web service requested based on the authorization policy  614  associated with the request or attached to the requested web service. 
     A firewall  620  may also be disposed between the application server  616  and the reverse proxy server  602  and web services gateway  604 . The firewall  620  provides additional security for the system  600  along with firewall  612 .

US-5913778-A,"A basketball mounting system for an in-ground basketball system has a flanged basketball support pole and a flanged ground sleeve receiving a portion of the pole in overlapping relationship. The flanges are connected together by removable fasteners such as threaded bolts. In addition, the mounting system may include jacking members in the pole flange to facilitate removal of the pole from the ground sleeve. The jacking members include members such as threaded bolts passing through the pole flange that, when rotated in one direction, press against the ground sleeve flange causing the pole and the ground sleeve to separate.","BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     1. Field of the Invention 
     The invention relates generally to a mounting system for an in-ground basketball system and, more particularly, to a flanged ground sleeve that receives in overlapping relationship an end of a flanged pole, and which may incorporate a mechanical device to facilitate removal of the pole from the ground sleeve. 
     2. Related Art 
     In-ground basketball systems are usually permanently mounted in the ground adjacent a playing surface, such as a driveway. Traditionally, a basketball system includes a pole supporting a backboard and a goal. To rigidly support the basketball system in a upright position, in the past, a hole was formed in the ground, filled with concrete and one end of the pole, was sunk directly in the concrete and the concrete was allowed to set. Then, the backboard and goal would be assembled on the top end of the pole. Once the concrete has set, the pole is essentially permanently mounted and, effectively, cannot be removed short of digging up the ground and breaking the concrete slug off of the end of the pole. 
     However, it may be desirable or necessary to remove the pole from the ground after installation for purposes of maintenance, convenience, storage, relocation and/or security. Removability is particularly important for heavy duty and/or high performance basketball systems because consumers are more likely to want to move these more expensive systems. 
     One approach that has been used to provide basketball pole removability is known as an anchor bolt style footing. In one such known footing, the anchor includes a stem with a flat square plate including bolt openings disposed on one end of the stem. The stem is set in the concrete so that the flat plate provides a flat mounting surface for a pole of the type having a square flat plate at its lowermost end. The pole flat plate has bolt openings alignable with the bolt openings in the anchor. The pole plate is aligned on the anchor plate; and nuts and bolts are used to secure the two flat plates together. This manner of mounting a basketball pole, however, is difficult because it: is susceptible to tipping over if the bolts break or the nuts are loosened/removed; and is difficult, if not impossible, to remove the pole once the bolts, nuts and flange seize over time due to corrosion and exposure to the elements. 
     Another approach that has been used to removably mount an in-ground basketball system is through the use of a ground sleeve. A ground sleeve is generally an elongated tubular member having an open end and a closed end, which is often in the form of a cap or cover. During installation, the ground sleeve is positioned in the fresh concrete with the open end exposed to receive the end of a conventional basketball pole that would otherwise have been sunk directly in the concrete. The pole is received in the open end of the ground sleeve. The size of the ground sleeve is usually somewhat larger than the size of the pole to accommodate manufacturing tolerances and variations in size, and to facilitate assembly on location. Accordingly, once the pole is disposed in the ground sleeve, it is loose and the pole must be secured fixedly in the ground sleeve so that the pole will not tilt or rotate. 
     In one known ground sleeve, a locking tab is used to secure the pole and ground sleeve together. The locking tab is inserted in the gap between the pole and the ground sleeve and a bolt is threaded through the tab perpendicular to the tab and the pole. When the bolt is tightened, the end of the bolt presses against the side of the pole causing the pole to be tightened in the ground sleeve. However, the gap between the pole and the ground sleeve remains open at the open end of the ground sleeve allowing rain and debris to enter and collect between the inside of the ground sleeve and the pole. Over time, this exposure to the weather may cause the pole and ground sleeve to corrode and seize making pole removal difficult if not impossible. 
     A better way of securing a ground sleeve and pole together is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,571,229 to Fitzsimmons et al., assigned to the assignee of this application. Fitzsimmons et al. &#39;229 discloses a ground sleeve having a deformable end that is secured to the pole by screwing a cap on the deformable end of the ground sleeve to form a collet having an adjustable opening for engaging the pole. The ground sleeve and cap are formed of a corrosion resistant material and the cap helps protect the ground sleeve and the end of the pole from the elements, thereby facilitating removal of the pole even after a long passage of time. 
     Another known ground sleeve mounting system includes a flat square flange plate covering its open end to form a flat mounting surface. The basketball pole has another flat square flange plate covering its outermost end. The flanges are approximately 12 inches by 12 inches. During installation, the pole plate is disposed on the ground sleeve plate and the plates are clamped together by nuts and bolts. This construction is susceptible to tipping over during installation, or if the bolts break or the nuts are loosened/removed. Moreover, due to exposure to the elements, the bolts, nuts and flanges may corrode and attach together making removal of the pole difficult if not impossible. 
     Mounting systems for supporting a pole in the ground in non-basketball environments often are overly complicated or cumbersome, are not designed to facilitate removal, and often require the use of an intermediate sleeve. One type of pole stand is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,337,989 to Apple. The Apple &#39;989 patent discloses a cylindrical two-piece pole stand assembly where two internal pivots arms are engaged upon insertion of the pole to lock the two pieces together. In particular, a tubular insert is disposed in a ground sleeve until a collar on the tubular insert comes to rest on a collar on the ground sleeve. The insertion of a pole (not shown) into the tubular insert causes pivot arms on the interior of tubular insert to engage the collar on ground sleeve, thereby locking the tubular insert and ground sleeve together. This device requires not only the use of a tubular sleeve in addition to the pole, but also requires the pole to lock the tubular sleeve to the ground sleeve. Although not shown, the pole would finally come to rest on the bottom of the ground sleeve. Moreover, the ground sleeve has a drainage hole which exposes the interior of the sleeve and the pole to the elements. 
     In U.S. Pat. No. 3,612,287 to Maltese, a tubular upright support member for floor display fixtures is inserted into a tapered floor plug through the use of a tapered tubular adapter. To vary the height of the support member, a locknut is variably positioned on a threaded end of the support member. Then, the threaded end of the support member is threaded into the adapter, and the tapered end of the adapter is wedged into the floor plug. The support member and the adapter are not otherwise secured into the floor plug. Similar, to Apple &#39;989, the Maltese &#39;287 pole mounting system requires the use of an intermediate member to mount the pole. Moreover, because the adapter frictionally engages the floor plug, removal is difficult, especially if other shaped members are used such as square. 
     The foregoing discussion shows there is a need for an improved ground sleeve for basketball systems that is capable of supporting even the most heavy duty of in-ground basketball systems in a substantially upright rigid and stable position without the risk of tipping, yet also can be readily removed even if the pole and the ground sleeve have seized due to exposure to the elements and/or corrosion. Moreover, a simple interconnection between the pole and ground that eliminates the need for intermediate connecting members also is needed. 
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The invention meets these needs and avoids the drawbacks and disadvantages of the prior art by providing a mounting system for supporting an in-ground basketball system including a flanged ground sleeve used in combination with a flanged pole in which a portion of the basketball support pole and the ground sleeve overlap to prevent the pole from tipping over when unsecured. 
     In one particularly advantageous embodiment of the invention, this is accomplished by having the pole flange, which is disposed intermediate but near one of the pole ends, and the ground sleeve flange each extend outwardly from the longitudinal axis of the support system. One end of the pole is received within the open end of the ground sleeve until the flanges come into contact and the pole cannot be inserted any further, thereby creating an overlap between the pole and ground sleeve. Removable connectors couple the ground sleeve flange and the pole flange together outside of the basketball pole. The connectors may be in the form of weld nuts and bolts associated with the pole and ground sleeve flanges. In practice, an overlap between the pole and ground sleeve on the order of about five inches is sufficient to hold the system in place without having to rely upon the function of any of the bolts. 
     In another embodiment of the invention, the pole flange may have a portion that is curved or tapered relative to the longitudinal axis of the basketball support pole. This feature improves the strength of the flange. In addition, the ground sleeve flange may be formed to have a shape corresponding to the ground sleeve flange to assist with positioning and alignment of the pole flange and the pole in the ground sleeve. 
     According to another aspect of the invention, the in-ground basketball support system may include one or more jacking members forming a release system facilitating the removal of the pole from the ground sleeve. The jacking member may be in the form of a bolt threaded through only one of the flanges, preferably the pole flange. In one embodiment, two jacking members are disposed on opposing sides of the pole. In operation, any mechanical connectors used to connect the pole to the ground sleeve during installation are removed. Then, the jacking bolt is rotated in one direction until the pole and the ground sleeve separate so that the pole can be removed entirely from the ground sleeve. 
     The overlapping pole and ground sleeve design of the invention in conjunction with the flanged connection provides a stronger interface with less flange area required than typically was the case in prior ground sleeve support systems. The overlapping design is an inherent safety feature that eliminates or significantly reduces the likelihood of a system falling over and causing damage, especially during installation, maintenance or pole removal. The release system of the invention provides a mechanical assist for separating the pole that heretofore has not been commercially available in prior basketball support systems. 
     Other features and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings and the appended claims.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS 
     Referring to FIG. 1, an in-ground basketball system of the invention is shown generally at 10. In-ground basketball system 10 generally includes a ground sleeve 12, a basketball support pole 18, a backboard 20 and a goal 24. In particular, ground sleeve 12 is substantially encased in concrete 14 filled in a hole in ground 16. Pole 18 has a bottom end 28 removably secured, in accordance with the invention, in ground sleeve 12 and a top end 30 supporting backboard 20 by way of support arms 22. Goal 24 is mounted on a front face of backboard 20 supported on pole 18 in a conventional manner. As shown, goal 24 has a net 26 hanging therefrom. 
     Referring now to FIGS. 2-4, an enlarged overview of a basketball pole mounting system constructed in accordance with the principles of the invention will be discussed. Pole 18 is removably secured in ground sleeve 12 along a longitudinal axis 17 of the support system in a manner discussed below such that longitudinal axis is substantially upright. Generally, pole 18 has a peripheral flange 32 extending outwardly from pole 18 intermediate bottom end 28 and top end 30. It is preferred that flange 32 be much closer to bottom end 28 than top end 30. Ground sleeve 12 has a peripheral flange 34 extending outwardly from an open end 63 of ground sleeve 12 (shown best in FIG. 10). Bottom end 28 of pole 18 is received within ground sleeve 12 in overlapping relationship and flanges 32, 34 are connected to secure pole 18 and ground sleeve 12 together. 
     Ground sleeve 12 is disposed in concrete such that flange 34 is disposed above top surface 13 of concrete 14 as shown in FIG. 3, with a spacing of approximately 1 inch above the top surface being preferred. However, flange 34 need only be disposed slightly above top surface 13 of concrete 14 so long as concrete 14 does not interfere with the mechanical connection of flange 32 to flange 34. For example, it is desirable that concrete 14 does not contact weld nuts 78b, 80b, 82b and 84b provided on lower surface 76 of ground sleeve flange 34, which are described subsequently. Upon installation of pole 18 into ground sleeve 12, bottom end 28 is received in the ground sleeve 12 until flange 32 contacts flange 34. Then, flange 32 is secured to flange 34 as described in detail in the following discussion. 
     The details of one embodiment of basketball support pole 18 will now be discussed with reference to FIGS. 5-7. Pole 18 preferably is a hollow elongated member having a thin peripheral wall 37 formed by four sides 38, 40, 42 and 44 interconnected by four generally rounded comers. Wall 37 preferably is formed from a rigid material such as metal, for example, 11 gauge steel with a thickness of approximately 0.12 inches. In transverse cross-section, pole 18 has a generally square shape with a 4 inch exterior length and a 4 inch exterior width. Pole 18 has a length of a standard in-ground basketball pole, for example, approximately 141.25 inches in total length. Pole 18 may include pole sections, in particular, two 54 inch pole sections and one 34.625 inch pole section; or, for purposes of compact shipping, may include three substantially equal length pole sections each having a 47 inch length. Bottom end 28 and top end 30 of pole 18 preferably are open as illustrated in the top and bottom views of pole 18 shown in FIGS. 5 and 6. Top end 30 may be closed by a pole cap 31 as shown in FIG. 1. Other pole shapes, sizes and constructions may be employed without departing from the principles of the invention as will be recognized by the skilled artisan. 
     Pole flange 32 may be formed from a flat annular ring having an upper surface 56 and lower surface 58 with a central opening therein and through which pole 18 is disposed. Flange 32 is fixedly secured to the outer periphery of pole 18 by welding, for example. Preferably, the weld is made on an upper surface 56 of flange 32 as illustrated in FIG. 7 at 57, so as to not interfere with the interface between flange 32 and flange 34. Flange 32 extends outwardly from pole 18 in a direction substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis 19 of pole 18, although other orientations may be employed. Flange 32 is disposed on pole 18 preferably about 5.25 inches inwardly from the outermost portion 47 of bottom end 28 so as to define approximately a 5.25 inch pole section 46 that is received in overlapping relationship with ground sleeve 12 for purposes discussed in detail later. The exact placement of flange 32 along pole 18 and thereby the length of the pole overlap section 46 may vary so long as the length received within ground sleeve 12 is sufficiently long to prevent pole 18 from tipping over, and to adequately limit vibration and movement of pole 18 during play. 
     An outer periphery of pole flange 32 defines a substantially square shape with rounded comers corresponding to the square shape of pole 18. If the outer length and width of flange 32 is approximately 7 inches, flange 32 extends a distance of approximately 1.5 inches outwardly from the outer peripheral wall 37 of a 4 inch square pole 18. The thickness of the flange 32 between upper and lower surfaces 56, 58 may be preferably approximately 0.38 inches. Because the invention includes pole overlap section 46, the size of flange 32 may be reduced without sacrificing stability as discussed in greater detail later. However, the precise size, shape and thickness of flange 32 may be varied so long as the flange is sufficiently strong to bear the load of basketball system 10 without causing flanges 32 and 34 to fail, such as by bending, during steady state installation, play, inclement weather and removal. For example, when larger backboards are used or when ground sleeve 12 and pole 18 must support an unusually large amount of weight, then flanges 32 and 34 may be enlarged in size and/or thickness in a manner readily apparent to the skilled artisan. 
     Pole flange 32 is adapted to be connected to flange 34 of ground sleeve 12. In particular, as shown in FIGS. 5-6, each of the four corners of flange 32 has a clearance hole 48, 50, 52 and 54 passing there through, preferably 0.5 in diameter. As discussed in detail later, a threaded bolt 60 (FIG. 12) is passed through each of clearance holes 48, 50, 52 and 54, respectively, and then into corresponding clearance holes (discussed with reference to FIGS. 8-10) provided in flange 34 of ground sleeve 12. Nuts may be welded to the under side of ground sleeve flange 34 to receive the bolt 60 for fixedly, but removably securing pole 18 in ground sleeve 12. The size of clearance openings 48, 50, 52 and 54 may be varied from 0.5 inches so long as they are of a size sufficient to receive a bolt that is strong enough to withstand shearing and failure under the load of basketball system 10. In the alternative, the grade of bolt 60 may be increased. In accordance with this particular embodiment of the invention, a grade no. 2 bolt is used. 
     Referring now to FIGS. 8-10, the details of one embodiment of ground sleeve 12 will be discussed. Ground sleeve 12 includes a main body 66 having an open end 63 and an opposed, closed end 64 for receiving a bottom portion of pole 18. Similar to pole flange 32, ground sleeve flange 34 is in the form of a flat annular ring having upper and lower surfaces 74, 76 with a central opening through which open end 63 of main body 66 is disposed. Flange 34 is fixedly secured to main body 66 adjacent open end 63 by, for example, welding. Preferably, the weld is provided on lower surface 76 of flange 34 such that the weld does not interfere with the interface between flanges 32 and 34. 
     Flange 34 extends outwardly from main body 66 in a manner substantially perpendicular to a longitudinal axis 19a of ground sleeve 34, which should be coincident with longitudinal axis 19 of pole 18 to define a longitudinal axis 17 of the mounting system when installed within ground sleeve 12. Main body 66 is a hollow member formed by a wall 62 of a rigid material such as metal, for example, 11 gauge steel, having a thickness of approximately 0.12 inches and length of approximately 17 inches. These dimensions offer adequate stability and anchoring for the basketball system 10, however, ground sleeve 12 may be formed of other thicknesses or lengths depending upon the particular design employed. Main body 66 has a substantially square transverse cross-sectional shape to match the shape of pole 18, but other shapes for both the ground sleeve and pole may be employed as will be recognized by the skilled artisan. 
     Closed end 64 at the lower end of ground sleeve 12 is disposed in concrete 14 and open end 63 at the upper end of ground sleeve 12 receives pole 18. Main body 66, as shown, is integrally formed with closed end 64, however, in the alternative, the lower end may be formed with an open end closed by a cap. The configuration of ground sleeve 12 varies along its longitudinal axis 19a. In particular, main body 66 has a first portion 68 that has an expanded size in transverse cross-section and a second portion 70, which is slightly narrower in transverse cross-section than first portion 68. First portion 68 is configured to receive pole overlap section 46 therein. A small shoulder or ledge 72 is formed between the first and second portions 68, 70. First portion 68 has a shape corresponding to the shape of pole 18 and interior dimensions slightly larger than the exterior dimensions of pole overlap 46 of pole 18. For example, first portion 68 may have an interior transverse cross-sectional length and width of about 4.030×4.030 inches and a longitudinal length ofjust over about 5.25 inches. This interior size should provide for a loose fit or a slip fit between the exterior surface of pole 18 and the interior surface of first portion 68 of ground sleeve 12. Preferably, this fit is not an interference fit to facilitate removability. First portion 68 may be formed with a larger interior dimension. However, enlarging the transverse size of the interior of first portion 68, and thereby creating a significant gap between pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, may sacrifice stability of the support system and possibly introduce vibration and movement into the system. First portion 68 may also include a tapered portion 82 at open end 63 that is slightly larger than first portion 68 and which tapers inwardly to the size of first portion 68. This tapered portion 82 facilitates insertion of bottom end 28 of pole 18 into ground sleeve 12. Tapered portion 82 is also illustrated in FIG. 11. 
     Second portion 70 of main body 66 extends from first portion 68 to closed end 64, and preferably has a transverse length and width slightly smaller than the transverse length and width of first portion 68. For example, second portion 70 may have the same transverse size and shape as pole 18 and a longitudinal length of approximately 11.75 inches. As second portion 70 is slightly smaller than first portion 68, the transition area between first portion 66 and second portion 70 forms the small shoulder or ledge 72 on the interior of main body 66. Preferably, the end of pole overlap section 46 ends just before ledge 72 such that flanges 32 and 34 define the point of contact upon insertion of pole 18 into ground sleeve 12, i.e. the bottom of pole 18 will not contact the ledge 72. 
     In accordance with another aspect of the invention, tubular members with the same transverse cross-sectional dimensions can be used to produce both pole 18 and ground sleeve 12. Thus, to form ground sleeve 12, one end of this tubular member is expanded in any conventional manner known in the metal working art to form first portion 68 and second portion 70 remains unaltered with the same transverse size as pole 18. In the alternative, ground sleeve 12 need not have a variation in its transverse size along longitudinal axis 19a and may have a constant transverse interior dimension for its entire length, which would be the transverse interior size of first portion 68. 
     Flange 34 has a shape and size corresponding to the shape and size of flange 32 on pole 18. Upper surface 74 of flange 34 is adapted to contact lower surface 58 of flange 32 and lower surface 76 of flange 34 is adapted to be positioned in the vicinity of top surface 13 of concrete 14 or ground 16. The thickness of ground sleeve flange 34 may be approximately 0.375 inches. Flange 32 includes at each of its four comers a clearance hole 78a, 80a, 82a, and 84a, each of which has about a 0.72 inch diameter to receive four 0.5 inch diameter opening nuts 78b, 80b, 82b, and 84b preferably welded to lower surface 76 of flange 32. Thus, weld nuts 78b, 80b, 82b and 84b define about 0.5 inch diameter openings each for receiving bolt 60. 
     The invention enables the size, width, and especially the length of flanges 32 and 34 to be reduced without sacrificing stability compared with the dimensions that would be required if pole overlap section 46 was not provided. For example, with the invention, 7 inch square pole and ground sleeve flanges can adequately support at least a basketball system with a 54 inch backboard and a 1,500 pound hang weight, which is measured off goal 24. However, other dimensions may be employed as will be recognized by the skilled artisan. For example, an enlarged flange may be provided, typically, in the range of approximately 7-10 inches when a heavier or larger basketball system is to be supported. In particular, 10 inch square flanges may be used to support a basketball system with a 72 inch backboard and a 6 inch pole. 
     Referring now to FIG. 11, a cross-sectional view taken along line 11--11 in FIG. 4 will now be discussed. As shown, bottom end 28 of pole 18 is guided into ground sleeve 12 via tapered opening 82 until lower surface 58 of flange 32 abuts upper surface 74 of flange 34. Accordingly, pole overlap section 46 is completely disposed in ground sleeve 12. As shown, pole overlap section 46 loosely fits into first portion 68 such that the outer periphery of pole overlap section 46 is adjacent the inner periphery of first portion 68 of ground sleeve 12. As discussed earlier, this loose fit facilitates removal of pole 18 from ground sleeve 12 without sacrificing stability. Bolts 60 are of the type having a head and a threaded shaft. The threaded shaft of bolt 60 is passed through, respectively, clearance openings 48, 50, 52, and 54 in flange 32, then through clearance openings 78a, 80a, 82a, and 84a in flange 34, and finally, are threaded into weld nuts 78b, 80b, 82b, and 84b provided on lower surface 76 of flange 34 until flanges 32 and 34 are secured together. 
     Referring now to FIG. 12, in combination with FIGS. 5, 6, 8 and 9, jacking devices shown generally at 90 will be discussed. In particular, to remove pole 18 from ground sleeve 12, bolts 60 must be removed and pole 18 must be withdrawn along longitudinal axis 19 until pole overlap section 46 is outside of ground sleeve 12. Generally, ground sleeve 12 is left behind. However, over time, the interface between pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, in particular, pole flange 32 and ground sleeve flange 34, may attach or become fixed to each other under the pressure of basketball system 10 weighing down on pole 18 in ground sleeve 12 and/or due to corrosion or exposure to the elements. If this occurs, pole 18 cannot easily be removed from ground sleeve 12 by a consumer. To overcome this problem, jacking devices 90 in accordance with the invention can force pole 18 to move longitudinally away from ground sleeve 12 and separate these parts. 
     In particular, jacking devices 90 include a pair of clearance openings 92a and 92b, preferably about 0.72 inch in diameter, passing through pole flange 32 for receiving weld nuts 94a and 94b, preferably about 0.5 inches in diameter, disposed on upper surface 56 of pole flange 32 in alignment with clearance openings 92a and 92b. Clearance openings 92a and 92b and weld nuts 94a and 94b are preferably centrally disposed on opposing sides of pole 18 to distribute their force equally across the interface between pole 18 and ground sleeve 12. Ground sleeve flange 34 remains unaltered and upper surface 74 of ground sleeve flange 34 abuts lower surface 58 of pole flange 32 to cover openings 92a and 92b. A pair of bolts 96a and 96b are screwed into weld nuts 94a and 94b and extend into clearance openings 92a and 92b, respectively. 
     When removal of pole 18 from ground sleeve 12 is desired, bolts 96a and 96b are rotated or tightened in weld nuts 94a and 94b causing ends 98a and 98b to abut upper surface 74 of ground sleeve flange 34. As bolts 96a and 96b continue to be tightened, pole 18 is forced apart from ground sleeve 12. In particular, lower surface 58 of pole flange 32 and the outer periphery of pole overlap section 46 are forced, as necessary, to separate from upper surface 74 of ground sleeve flange 34 and the inner periphery of ground sleeve 12. 
     Bolts 96a and 96b and the corresponding clearance openings 92a and 92b and weld nuts 94a and 94b are of a size, grade, and strength sufficient to create a force, upon tightening bolts 96a and 96b, that overcomes the force holding pole 18 to ground sleeve 12. For example, if a larger basketball system with a 72 inch board and 6 inch pole is to be removed, a higher grade bolt may be used. As shown, jacking devices 90 are positioned to effectively apply force to the entire interface between ground sleeve 12 and pole 18, however, a single or, in the alternative, additional jacking devices 90 and alternate dispositions of the jacking device(s) may be employed so long as they function in accordance with the invention. 
     Referring now to FIG. 13, another embodiment of the invention including reinforcing webs is illustrated. For example, web 100 may extend between side 42 of pole 18 and upper surface 74 of pole flange 32 to reinforce the connection between flange 32 and pole 18 and to limit or prevent flange 32 from deflecting. As shown, web 100 has a substantially flat trapezoidal shape, however, other shapes and configurations are contemplated. Similar webs may be formed between ground sleeve flange 34 and main body 66 of ground sleeve 12. Any quantity of webs may be used in accordance with the invention to achieve the desired strength. 
     In the embodiments shown in FIGS. 14-17 the pole flange is shaped particularly to provide additional strength. Moreover, in the embodiment shown in FIGS. 17 and 18, the ground sleeve flange also is shaped to facilitate alignment of the pole into the ground sleeve during installation. Only aspects of these embodiments that differ substantially from the embodiments described previously are discussed below. 
     Referring to FIGS. 14 and 15, pole 18 has a flange 102 and ground sleeve 12 has a flange 104. In this embodiment, flange 102 is dome- or bell-shaped and includes a curved portion 103 and a flat portion 105, which is disposed substantially perpendicular to longitudinal axis 19 and is adapted for attachment to flange 104 in the manner discussed above. Flange 102 is welded on pole 18 at both upper surface 56 and lower surface 58 as shown by welds 112. The outer dimension of flange 102 as shown is 7 inches square, for example. A peripheral cavity 110 is formed between lower surface 106 of flange 102 and upper surface 108 of flange 104. Cavity 110 may have approximately a maximum 1 inch longitudinal height. 
     Ground sleeve flange 104 is substantially the same as ground sleeve flange 34 discussed earlier, however, it is disposed on main body 66 slightly lower, approximately 0.375 inches, than open end 63 of ground sleeve 12 such that flange 104 can be welded on pole 18 at both upper surface 74 and lower surface 76 as shown by welds 112. In this embodiment, because part of flanges 102 and 104 are separated from each other by cavity 110, flanges 102 and 104 may be welded to pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, respectively, on both their upper and lower surfaces 56, 58, 74 and 76, respectively, without interfering with the interface between flanges 102 and 104. However, as discussed with reference to the embodiment shown in FIGS. 1-12, flanges 32 and 34 can be welded to pole 18 and ground sleeve 12 only on the sides facing away from the interface while still providing the required strength to support basketball system 10. This embodiment shown in FIGS. 14 and 15 also has the inherent advantage of a reduced amount of surface contact between flanges 102 and 104, which is advantageous to the removability aspect of the invention. 
     Referring now to FIGS. 16 and 17, an embodiment of the invention is disclosed where pole 18 includes tapered flange 113 and ground sleeve 12 includes tapered flange 114. Tapered flanges 113 and 114 are attached to pole 18 and ground sleeve 12, respectively, preferably by welding as described earlier, however, the welds are not illustrated. 
     More specifically, pole flange 113 has a tapered portion 116 extending outwardly toward ground sleeve 12 at an acute angle to longitudinal axis 19, however, linearly rather than curvilinearly as with flange 102. Flange 113 creates a small cavity 118 between a lower surface of flange 113 and an upper surface of flange 114 such that welds may be applied to both sides of flanges 113 and 114 so long as they do not interfere with the interface between flanges 113 and 114. Flange 113 also has a flat outer peripheral portion 117 that is disposed substantially perpendicularly to longitudinal axis 19 and is adapted for attachment to flange 114 in the manner discussed above. 
     Moreover, in this embodiment, ground sleeve flange 114 also has a corresponding peripheral tapered portion 120 extending from open end 63 of ground sleeve 12 at substantially the same acute angle to longitudinal axis 19 as tapered portion 116. This tapered portion 120 nests in cavity 118 of flange 113 thereby assisting in guiding and aligning pole 18 into ground sleeve 12 during installation. A flat portion 121 of flange 114 extends substantially perpendicularly to longitudinal axis 19 and is adapted for attachment to flange 112 in accordance with the invention. 
     Although not particularly shown in FIGS. 15-18, these embodiments of the invention may also include jacking devices 90 discussed earlier to facilitate removal of pole 18 from ground sleeve 12.","What is claimed is:

US-PP18508-P2,"A new cultivar of  Hydrangea  plant named ‘RIE 05’ that is characterized by broad upright habit, large dark grey-green leaves, flowers that range in color from yellow-green to light and dark pink, and unique inflorescence development. In combination these traits set ‘RIE 05’ apart from all other existing varieties of  Hydrangea  known to the inventor.","Genus:  Hydrangea.  Species:  macrophylla.    
   Denomination: ‘RIE 05’. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of  hydrangea  that is grown for use as an indoor floral potted plant and an outdoor ornamental flowering shrub. The new cultivar is known botanically as  Hydrangea macrophylla  and will be referred to hereinafter by the cultivar name ‘RIE 05’. 
   ‘RIE 05’ resulted from a breeding program that was conducted by the inventor at the inventor&#39;s nursery in Kyoto, Japan and began in 1990. The purpose of the breeding program was to produce new varieties of floral potted hydrangeas the exhibit new and unique flowers and flower color. 
   Between May 1990 and May 1993 the inventor assembled a collection of unnamed and unreleased hybrids from a sequence of deliberate pollinations involving the following cultivars, all unpatented, and available in commerce in Japan:  Hydrangea macrophylla  ‘Otafuku’,  Hydrangea macrophylla,  ‘Yamaajisai’, and  Hydrangea macrophylla  ‘Fijinishiritaki’. The inventor did not record which variety was used as male parent and which as female parent. In May 1993, the inventor carried out a deliberate pollination between one unnamed plant from the inventor&#39;s collection as female parent and the variety  Hydrangea macrophylla  ‘Sumidanohanabi’ (unpatented) as male parent. 
   The pollination described above produced thirty-five individual varieties, which the inventor considered novel and unusual. One of these individual varieties was selected by the inventor in June 1994 and is the subject of the present invention, ‘RIE 05’. 
   ‘RIE 05’ is a deciduous shrub that exhibits large dark grey-green leaves and individual flowers that range in color from yellow-green to light and dark pink. Selection was based on the distinguishing characteristics of flowers, flower color, and inflorescence development. ‘RIE 05’ most resembles the “mophead” type of hydrangea. “Mophead” type hydrangeas produce showy sterile flowers along the outside of the inflorescence, and small inner flowers that are fertile flowers. However, ‘RIE 05’ is different in that there are no fertile flowers in the inflorescence which consists of sterile flowers only. ‘RIE 05’ is distinguishable from the parent plants by flower color, and unique inflorescence development, which produces an average of 270 sterile flowers per inflorescence. It is also distinguished by the darkening of the flower color with age and in that a single plant might have inflorescences of different ages and therefore several shades of colors are displayed simultaneously. 
   The inventor considers that ‘RIE 05’ is distinct from other varieties of  Hydrangea  known to the inventor in the following respects: 
   First, whereas other varieties of  Hydrangea  in commerce have four petals per floret on a flat, one-dimensional plane, ‘RIE 05’ has two to three layers of petals per floret, creating a double-flower appearance. 
   Second, whereas many novel varieties have been found in, or brought from, Japan in recent years, none appear to have the combination of uniqueness of flower form as above combined with greater vigor and faster growing to flowering stage which typifies ‘RIE 05’. 
   Third, the vigor of ‘RIE 05’ is evident in its strong thick stems which do not require staking to support the heavy blooms. ‘RIE 05’, although vigorous, exhibits a shorter internode distance than many other commercial forms of  Hydrangea,  allowing ‘RIE 05’ to be grown commercially with less or even no application of growth regulating chemical. 
   ‘RIE 05’ was first asexually propagated by the inventor, in the spring of 1995 in a cultivated area of Kyoto, Japan. The method used for asexual propagation was softwood cuttings. The characteristics of the new  Hydrangea  cultivar named ‘RIE 05’ have been determined stable and are reproduced true to type in successive generations of asexual propagation. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   The following traits have been repeatedly observed and represent the characteristics of the new  Hydrangea  cultivar ‘RIE 05’. These traits in combination distinguish ‘RIE 05’ from all other commercial varieties of  Hydrangea  known to the inventor. ‘RIE 05’ has not been tested under all possible conditions and phenotypic differences may be observed with variations in environmental, climatic and cultural conditions, without however, any difference in genotype.

   Cultivar denomination: ‘SUNPHLOSUPAPI’. 
   BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
   The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of  Phlox  plant, botanically known as  Phlox drummondii  and hereinafter referred to by the name ‘Sunphlosupapi’. 
   The new  Phlox  plant is a naturally-occurring branch mutation of a proprietary selection of  Phlox drummondii  identified as code number 0Ph-18a-M, not patented. The new  Phlox  was discovered and selected by the Inventor from within a population of plants of the parent selection in a controlled greenhouse environment in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan in August, 2006. 
   Asexual reproduction of the new  Phlox  plant by cuttings in a controlled greenhouse environment in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan since September, 2006, has shown that the unique features of this new  Phlox  plant are stable and reproduced true to type in successive generations. 
   SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
   Plants of the new  Phlox  have not been observed under all possible environmental conditions. The phenotype may vary somewhat with variations in environment and cultural practices such as temperature and light intensity without, however, any variance in genotype. 
   The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be the unique characteristics of ‘Sunphlosupapi’. These characteristics in combination distinguish ‘Sunphlosupapi’ as a new and distinct cultivar of  Phlox:  
         1. Upright and outwardly spreading plant habit.   2. Vigorous growth habit.   3. Freely branching and flowering habit.   4. Long flowering period.   5. Light pink-colored flowers with red purple-colored centers.   6. Good garden performance.       

   Plants of the new  Phlox  differ from plants of the parent selection primarily in flower color as plants of the parent selection have white-colored flowers with red purple-colored central star. 
   Plants of the new  Phlox  can also be compared to plants of  Phlox drummondii  ‘Sunphlopin’, disclosed in U.S. Plant Pat. No. 16,361. In side-by-side comparisons conducted in Higashiomi, Shiga, Japan, plants of the new  Phlox  and ‘Sunphlopin’ differed in the following characteristics:
         1. Plants of the new  Phlox  had thicker stems than plants of ‘Sunphlopin’.   2. Plants of the new  Phlox  had shorter internodes than plants of ‘Sunphlopin’.   3. Plants of the new  Phlox  had smaller leaves than plants of ‘Sunphlopin’.   4. Plants of the new  Phlox  and ‘Sunphlopin’ differed in flower color.

     Variety denomination: ‘Airborne’. 
     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The present invention relates to a new and distinct cultivar of  Phalaenopsis  plant, botanically known as  Phalaenopsis  of the Orchidaceae family, and hereinafter referred to by the cultivar name ‘Airborne’. 
       Phalaenopsis  comprises a genus of about 55 species of herbaceous perennials many of which, or the hybrids thereof, are suitable for cultivation in the home or greenhouse.  Phalaenopsis  is predominantly epiphytic or rock-dwelling, and is native to tropical Asia, the Malay Archipelago, and Oceania. The species typically has 2-ranked, fleshy, oblong or elliptic leaves affixed to a short central stem (monopodial growth), which vary in size from 5 to 8 inches to over 2 feet. The leaves may be entirely green or mottled with silver grey. 
       Phalaenopsis  orchids, often referred to as ‘Moth Orchids’ in the horticultural trade, are frequently used to furnish cut flowers for the florist trade or sold as flowering potted-plants for home or interiorscape. 
       Phalaenopsis  produces upright or pendent lateral racemes, often with many showy flowers which open in succession beginning with the lowermost. The flowers possess three sepals and three petals; the lateral ones being alike. The lowermost petal, called the labellum, is three-lobed and is often more brightly-colored than the other flower segments. Flower colors include various shades of pink, white, yellow and red-brown. 
       Phalaenopsis  orchids are typically propagated from seeds. Asexual propagation of  Phalaenopsis  is often done from off-shoots which frequently arise from the lower bracts of the inflorescence. The resulting plants are detached from the mother plant and may be planted in a suitable substrate. 
     The new  Phalaenopsis  ‘Airborne’ is a product of a controlled breeding program conducted by the inventor, René Schoone, in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands. The objective of the breeding program was to develop a new  Phalaenopsis  cultivar particularly characterized by its attractive and unique colored flowers, economical propagation via tissue culture, rapid growth, and a plant dimension suitable for packaging and shipping to the market. 
     The new  Phalaenopsis  ‘Airborne’ originated from a cross made by the inventor in 1999 in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands. The female or seed parent is the  Phalaenopsis  cultivar designated ‘Sogo Tris’, unpatented. The male or pollen parent is the  Phalaenopsis  cultivar designated ‘Ta-Lin’, unpatented. The new  Phalaenopsis  ‘Airborne’ was discovered and selected by the inventor as a single flowering plant within the progeny of the stated cross in a controlled environment in 2007 in Strengweg, Heemskerk, The Netherlands. 
     Asexual reproduction of the new  Phalaenopsis  cultivar by tissue culture was first performed in November, 2007 in Cieweg 13, Heemskerk, The Netherlands, and has demonstrated that the combination of characteristics as herein disclosed for the new cultivar are firmly fixed and retained through successive generations of asexual reproduction. The new cultivar asexually reproduces true to type. 
     BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION 
     The following traits have been repeatedly observed and are determined to be unique characteristics of ‘Airborne’, which in combination distinguish this  Phalaenopsis  as a new and distinct cultivar:
         1. flowers which are mainly purple with irregular white bands at the margins and in the labellum some yellow;   2. plant produces more than one inflorescence;   3. plants may be propagated economically and uniformly using tissue culture;   4. inflorescences are long and sturdy; and   5. relatively short, dark-green foliage.       

     In comparison with the parental cultivars of ‘Airborne’, the flowers of the female parent ‘Sogo Tris’ are white with red/purple marks and a large purple midlobe and the male parent ‘Ta-Lin’ has white colored flowers, whereas the flowers of ‘Airborne’ are mainly purple with irregular white bands at the margins and in the labellum some yellow. 
     Presently, the commercial cultivar to which ‘Airborne’ can be meaningfully compared is ‘Ophelia’ (unpatented). ‘Airborne’ is a little smaller than ‘Ophelia’. The flowers of ‘Airborne’ are mainly purple with irregular white bands at the margins, whereas the flowers of ‘Ophelia’ have more white and have many purple marks and spots.

       BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION  
       [0002] 1. Field of the Invention  
       [0003] The present invention generally relates to a basketball retrieval and return devices and, more particularly, is concerned with a basketball shooting practice return apparatus having a retrieval net supported from above a backboard and a mechanism allowing adjustment of the vertical height of the front portion of the net above the shooting surface so as to establish the arch of the basketball shot that is required to clear the front portion of the net.  
       [0004] 2. Description of the Prior Art  
       [0005] One of the problems with solo practice shooting a basketball, such as free throws, is the necessity to retrieve the basketball after each shot. The basketball, whether the shot is made or missed, rarely bounces back to the location of the shooter. After each shot the shooter must chase after the basketball which, more likely than not, is bouncing or rolling away from the shooter. More time is typically consumed going after the errant basketball than actually practicing shots.  
       [0006] A variety of basketball retrieval devices have been proposed in the prior art. Representative of such prior art devices are the ones disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,056,652 to Lees et al. and U.S. Pat. No. 5,540,428 to Joseph. The Lees et al. and Joseph patents disclose basketball retrieval and return devices which appear to be steps in the right direction toward alleviating the aforementioned problem experienced in basketball solo practice shooting by eliminating the need to expend energy in chasing the basketball.  
       [0007] However, another problem of basketball shooting practice is how to train a shooter to learn to shoot the basketball with the needed amount of arch so as to be able to utilize all the available clearance provided between the basketball and hoop and thereby increase the likelihood of the basketball shot scoring by going through the rim or hoop. Neither Lees et al. nor Joseph devices appear to address the problem of training a shooter how to put the necessary arch on the basketball shot.  
       [0008] Consequently, a need still exists for a basketball practice shooting return apparatus which provides solutions to the aforementioned and other problems in the prior art without introducing any new problems in place thereof.  
       SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION  
       [0009] The present invention provides a basketball shooting practice return apparatus which is designed to satisfy the aforementioned needs. The basketball shooting practice return apparatus of the present invention solves the aforementioned problem providing a means to enable a shooter to practice shooting the basketball with adequate arch on the shot. A retrieval net of the apparatus is supported on and adjusted from above the backboard so as to facilitate easy adjustment of the vertical height of a front portion of the net above the shooting surface. The front portion of the net is used in shooting practice as a visual marker to show the shooter how high the shooter must shoot the basketball or, in other words, what amount of arch the shooter must place on the shot to clear the front portion of the net which will, in turn, be the amount of arch that will maximize the likelihood of the basketball going through the hoop by taking advantage of all the available clearance between the basketball and the backboard hoop which has a larger diameter than the basketball.  
       [0010] Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a basketball shooting practice return apparatus which comprises: (a) a framework for mounting on a backboard and having guide elements disposed above the backboard; (b) a pair of support members pivotally mounted to the framework below the guide elements thereon and above a hoop on the backboard; (c) a retrieval net assembly supported by the support members and spaced outwardly and hanging downwardly from above the hoop; (d) a net positioning mechanism operable for selectively applying and releasing a pulling force upon the retrieval net assembly and support members from the direction of the guide elements above the backboard so as to be able to pivotally move the retrieval net assembly and support members between a raised position extending forwardly from the backboard and a lowered vertical position extending downwardly from the backboard and to hold the retrieval net assembly and support members at any stationary position therebetween; and (e) a basketball return structure associated with the retrieval net assembly.  
       [0011] The present invention also is directed to a basketball shooting practice return apparatus which comprises: (a) a framework mountable on a backboard such that portions of the framework extend beyond opposite lateral sides and above a top side of the backboard and are exposed from forwardly of the backboard, the framework having a pair of guide elements located above the top side of the backboard on the portions of the framework extending above the top side of the backboard; (b) a pair of support members pivotally mounted at inner ends thereof to the portions of the framework extending beyond opposite lateral sides of the backboard such that the inner ends of the support members are located below the guide elements and above a hoop on the backboard; (c) a retrieval net assembly supported by the support members and spaced outwardly and hanging downwardly from above the hoop; (d) a net positioning mechanism operable for selectively applying and releasing a pulling force upon the retrieval net assembly and support members from the direction of the guide elements above the backboard so as to be able to pivotally move the retrieval net assembly and support members from a generally horizontal position extending forwardly from the backboard to a raised inclined position extending forwardly and upwardly from the backboard and above the hoop and to a lowered inclined position extending forwardly and downwardly from the backboard and above the hoop such that the height above the shooting surface of a front portion the retrieval net assembly can be adjusted to act as a visual marker of the proper arch for the shooter to place on the basketball shot; and (e) a basketball return structure associated with the retrieval net assembly.  
       [0012] These and other features and advantages of the present invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art upon a reading of the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the drawings wherein there is shown and described an illustrative embodiment of the invention.

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION  
     [0021] Referring to the drawings and particularly to FIGS.  1  to  4 , there is illustrated a basketball shooting practice return apparatus, generally designated  10 , of the present invention. The apparatus  10  basically includes a framework  12 , a pair of support members  14 , a retrieval net assembly  16 , a net positioning mechanism  18 , and a ground-supported basketball return structure  20 . The framework  12  is mountable on a back A of a backboard B and has opposite lateral side portions  12 A which extend beyond opposite lateral sides C and a top side D of the backboard B and are exposed from forwardly of the backboard B with the portions  12 A having a pair of guide elements  22  thereon being located above the top side D of the blackboard B. The support members  14  are pivotally mounted to the framework  12  below the guide elements  22  thereon and above a hoop E on the backboard B. The retrieval net assembly  16  is supported by the support members  14  and is spaced outwardly and hangs downwardly from above the hoop E. The net positioning mechanism  18  is operable for selectively applying and releasing a pulling force upon the retrieval net assembly  16  and support members  14  from the direction of the guide elements  22  above the backboard B so as to be able to pivotally move the retrieval net assembly  16  and support members  14  between a raised position extending forwardly from the backboard B, as seen in FIGS. 1, 3 and  4 , and a lowered vertical position extending downwardly from the backboard B, as seen in FIG. 2, and to hold the retrieval net assembly  16  and support members  14  at any stationary position therebetween. The ground-supported basketball return structure  20  is associated with the retrieval net assembly  16 .  
     [0022] More particularly, the framework  12  of the apparatus  10  has a generally rectangular configuration and is attached and mounted to the back A of the backboard B such that the opposite vertical side portions  12 A of the framework  12  are disposed beyond opposite sides C of the backboard B and exposed from forwardly of the backboard B. The support members  14  have generally straight rigid configurations and are pivotally mounted at their inner ends  14 A thereof to the opposite vertical side portions  12 A of the framework  12  at locations adjacent to upper ends of the opposite lateral sides C of the backboard B.  
     [0023] The retrieval net assembly  16  of the apparatus  10  includes a mounting frame  24  and a retrieval net  26  supported by the mounting frame  24 . The mounting frame  24  of the assembly  16  is supported by the support members  14  and has a pair of opposite side frame members  24 A and a front frame member  24 B extending between and interconnecting the opposite side frame members  24 A at forward ends thereof such that the mounting frame  24  has a generally U-shaped configuration. The opposite side frame members  24 A of the mounting frame  24  are tubular in configuration and at their inner ends  24 C are respectively slidably inserted over and removable from the support members  14  at outer ends  14 B thereof.  
     [0024] The retrieval net  26  of the assembly  16  has a generally funnel-shaped configuration and an open top end  26 A and an open bottom end  26 B substantially smaller in size than the open top end  26 A. The net  26  at opposite upper side portions  26 C and upper front portion  26 D of its open top end  26 A is respectively secured around the opposite side frame members  24 A and front frame member  24 B so as to hang downwardly therefrom so as to locate the opposite upper side portions  26 C and upper front portion  26 D of the net  26  outwardly from and above the hoop E on the backboard B.  
     [0025] The net positioning mechanism  18  includes a manually or power-operated winch  28  located at ground level within reach of a person using the apparatus  10  and a pair of cables  30  wound over the winch  28 . The cables  30  extend from the winch  28  upwardly to and through the guide elements in the form of loops  22  attached to upper ends of  12 B of opposite lateral side portions  12 A of the framework  12 . The cables  30  then extend downwardly to corners  16 A formed by the adjacent ends of the opposite side frame members  24 A and front frame member  24 B. When the tubular opposite side frame members  24 A are inserted over the support members  14 , the winch  28  can be operated by the person to wind and shorten the lengths of the cables  30  and thereby pull the cables  30  and lift the opposite side frame members  24 A and support members  14  and retrieval net  26  therewith, to a desired use position relative to the backboard B and hoop E, for example, with the support members  14  and mounting frame  24  disposed in a horizontal position H, extending outwardly from the opposite side portions  12 A of the framework  12 . By the cables  30  being connected to the outer corners  16 A of the assembly  16  and pulling rearwardly and upwardly therefrom, the cables  30  will retain the mounting frame  24  over the support members  14  at the desired use position. By a selected desired amount of unwinding or winding of the cables  30  from or around the winch  28  the support members  14  can be pivotally adjusted, raised or lowered, by a desired amount to change the use position of the mounting frame  24  and the support members  14  and net  26  therewith relative to the backboard B and hoop E. Further, by unwinding and thus lengthening the cables  30  the mounting frame  24  and the support members  14  and net  26  therewith can be pivotally lowered until the mounting frame  24  can slide off the support members  14  to thereby disassemble the retrieval net assembly  16  from the support members  14 . Once removed from the support members  14 , the retrieval net assembly  16  can be easily reduced in size for storage during periods of non-use. During periods of non-use, the support members  14  merely extend downwardly along the opposite side portions  12 A of the framework  12  out of the way of the backboard B and hoop E for allowing normal use of the backboard B.  
     [0026]FIG. 4 also shows, at dashed lines U and L, both the mounting frame  24  and retrieval net  26  respectively adjusted to a raised upper inclined position U placing its front frame member  24 B above the horizontal position H and at a first height above the shooting surface S (shown in FIG. 3) and a lowered inclined position L placing its front frame member  24 B below the horizontal position H and at a second height above the shooting surface S which is less than the first height. The net positioning mechanism  18  is operable for selectively applying and releasing a pulling force upon the retrieval net assembly  16  and said support members  14  from the direction of the guide elements  22  above the backboard B so as to be able to pivotally move the retrieval net assembly  16  and support members  14  from the generally horizontal position H extending forwardly from the backboard B to the raised inclined position U extending forwardly and upwardly from the backboard B and above the hoop E and to the lowered inclined position L extending forwardly and downwardly from the backboard B and above the hoop E such that the height above the shooting surface S of the front frame member  24 B of the retrieval net assembly  16  can be adjusted to act as a visual marker of the proper arch for the shooter to place on the basketball shot.  
     [0027] The ground-supported basketball return structure  20  has one end  20 A disposed adjacent to and below a collar  32  attached to the open lower end  26 B of the retrieval net  26  for receiving a basketball F therefrom. The return structure  20  has an opposite end  20 B disposed adjacent to the position where the person is shooting the basketball F. The return structure  20  includes a plurality of sections  34  extending between the opposite ends  20 A,  20 B thereof. Each section  34  has a pair of spaced apart elongated tracks  36  defining a path along which a basketball F can roll and ground-engaging support stands  38  detachably attached at upper ends to and extending downward from the tracks  36 . As seen in FIGS. 5 and 6, the sections  34  telescopically interfit together at opposite ends so as to form the free-standing return structure  20  capable of being adjusted in length so as to extend from below the open lower end  26 B of the net  26  to the desired location of the shooter. The sections  34  are easily taken apart and the support stands  38  removed to disassemble the return structure  20  for storage during periods of non-use.  
     [0028] Other advantages of the basketball shooting practice return apparatus  10  is that it can be mounted solely to the backboard B and thus is capable of being used in conjunction with both outdoor pole-supported backboards and indoor pole-free backboards. It is readily apparent that the parts of the apparatus  10  as described above are only mounted to the backboard B and not to the pole G supporting the backboard B. Thus, the apparatus  10  can be equally adapted for employment with a pole-supported or pole-free backboard.  
     [0029] It is thought that the present invention and its advantages will be understood from the foregoing description and it will be apparent that various changes may be made thereto without departing from its spirit and scope of the invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the form hereinbefore described being merely preferred or exemplary embodiment thereof.","I claim:

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION 
     Modern electronics enable access to rich libraries of content across a variety of devices. This content may include electronic books (“e-books”), periodicals, narrative web sites (e.g., blogs), rich media content (written content with embedded movies and/or audio, and electronic books. Publishers of these rich libraries are better able to monetize these libraries if the publishers are able to find content that is most responsive to a user&#39;s interest. However, navigating these libraries can be cumbersome and awkward and results in a less than positive experience if a user is forced to navigate less-than-interesting content while content more responsive to a user&#39;s interest is not surfaced. Therefore, a literary recommendation engine is configured to provide recommended content to a community of users. 
     A variety of stimuli exist that can be used to develop rich mathematical and analytical models in order to find the “best” content for a user. The “best” content may be identified as the content deemed most likely to be responsive to a user&#39;s interests. One stimuli that is available is includes a publishers catalog that is published with various records that describe the book and various attributes. For example, a publisher may distribute a record with a book title, ISBN number, author name, author bibliography, year of publishing, relationship to other works, and other labels that describe the book (e.g., genre, subgenre, mood, and special status indicators such as appearance on a specified bestseller list, indication one or more awards, and/or inclusion of a celebrity&#39;s “book of the month” list). A second stimulus may include a service that collects reader reviews and ratings. The reader reviews and ratings may be made available by a ratings service, a book publisher, and online retailer, and/or an online critic service. 
     Still other stimuli may be used. One other stimulus may include a very specialized service that semantically breaks down the plot of a book. For example, a content publisher may parse a book with an analytic engine that develops a mathematical model for the structure of the plot and the relationship between characters. The content publisher may supplement and/or verify the mathematic model for the plot structure of the plot with review by a human editor that adjusts the model developed by the computer. The parsing also may involve a categorization of the reading level, the historic timeframe (if applicable), dialect, character interaction, issues, themes, mood, and other labels that may assist in characterizing content. 
     With the availability of rich stimuli and data available to describe literary content, a recommendation engine may assimilate these diverse stimuli in a reconciliation process that aims to de-duplicate records. While in some cases the ISBN number may be used as a common index, in other cases, an ISBN number may not be accurate or be available. For example, a review engine may “crawl” the web for trends in literature. A tweet or comment on a blog may not be indexed with a precise label identifier. Thus, the supplemental content may undergo a degree of parsing to identify the underlying source content and confirm that the review in fact relates to the identified source content. A quote in a blog that features a name of a character in a novel and/or a book title may be analyzed to identify other content appearing in the web page to confirm that the excerpt specifically relates to a particular piece of content. 
     Once the content is assimilated into a database (distributed in multiple locations or consolidated into a single data store), the literary recommendation engine may be configured to support a user community. The user community may allow users to create online profiles that in turn are managed by the literary recommendation engine. The literary recommendation engine may monitor user navigation activities within the literary recommendation engine to develop a user and community profile of how users are finding their content. The literary recommendation may be configured to develop inferences so that as a user interacts with the literary recommendation engine, the literary recommendation engine identifies affinities between content for which a relationship may be identified. Thus, as a user selects a recommendation link and/or purchases the recommended content, the relationship metrics are modified to reflect that association. 
     In one configuration, the user submits the name of a “seed” book in order identify related content. In response to receiving the name of the seed book, the literary recommendation engine may pull up a literary data object for the book that includes metadata for the book. The metadata may include descriptions of related content. In one configuration, the metadata includes a complex mathematical model that describes the relationship between the book (or an author or genre) and other data objects (e.g., books or authors or genres or characters or plot elements or themes). The user profile then may be used in association with the literary data object to identify an affinity between the user profile and other literary data objects. For example, a particular seed book may involve a detective in the Soviet Union (e.g., Gorky Park by Martin Cruz Smith). A literary data object may identify include values that relate Gorky Park to novels by other authors (e.g., detective novels by Fredrikh Topol) in addition to other detective novels (e.g., Sherlock Holmes). The literary recommendation engine may identify the top 25 values with the largest magnitude from a subset of a much larger library of values. These top 25 values then may in turn be mapped on a multidimensional axis against a user profile to identify those selections with a strong magnitude that also aligns with the user&#39;s interest as expressed in the user&#39;s profile. The literary recommendation engine then may in turn identify the top X selections where X is a limit set to filter the content presented to the user. 
       FIGS. 1-8  are screenshots of a literary recommendation engine that is configured to provide literary recommendation services to a user community.  FIG. 1  is a user interface (UI)  100  that presents a literary recommendation engine through a web browser. As shown, the user with the specified profile NAME (e.g., John A. Smith) is presented with the ability to perform a search, perceive a list of recommendations, search by subject purchase books (as shown throw a shopping cart), browse the top stories by editors, or engage in a discovery process whereby the user can express their likes and dislikes in order to hone preferences and better identify more responsive content. As the user types in characters into the search entry field, a drop down window (not shown) may be presented that enables the user to perceive the content that aligns with the entered text). 
       FIG. 2  illustrates UI  200  of an interface that allows a user to enter a book name in order to launch a recommendation engine that content related to the content shown above. As shown, the user is permitted to enter up to three titles in order to generate responsive content. The user also may save links to the content that has been presented in order to allow the user to perceive the retrieved content at a later time. 
       FIG. 3  illustrates a UI  300  with a list of four results that have been retrieved that are responsive to the title that has been selected “Absolute Monarchs.” The user may interface with the retrieved links, for example, by selecting the “MORE LIKE THIS” link shown below the title. Selecting the MORE LIKE THIS link may be used to include the selected title as modifying criteria so that the newly employed model also reflects aspects of the newly-selected content. 
       FIG. 4  illustrates a UI  400  with a description of the factors that are used by the literary recommendation engine. Each of these aspects may represent one axis of a multidimensional axis as content is related to user requests, user profiles, and seed content. Of course, the analysis performed by the literary recommendation engine also may be modified to reflect current trends and popularity. Thus, a smaller value for results that include vampire-themed content may nevertheless allow vampire-themed results to be returned if vampire-themed content is popular. However, if the user actively navigates away from vampire-themed content, the impact of the popularity of vampire-themed content may be diminished so that vampire-themed content is not as likely to be returned in a list of recommendations. 
       FIG. 5  illustrates a UI  500  with a control that allows users to add additional content with the control that allows a user to ADD ANOTHER book to the list of recommendations. In addition, the list of recommendations also allows each recommendation to be explored by selecting the book icon for each result. 
       FIG. 6  illustrates a UI  600  with a control that allows users to surface literary recommendation engine content into a social network (e.g., Facebook or Twitter). Similarly, the social networking controls may allow information from the user&#39;s social network to modify the results of the literary recommendation engine. 
       FIG. 7  illustrates a UI  700  with a transaction interface that allows a user to rate, preview, purchase or disfavor specified content. The user also may specify delivery options for purchased content.  FIG. 8  illustrates a UI  800  that illustrates how two books are used as the basis for the list of recommendations shown. In one configuration, a common model with aspects of both books is developed to identify responsive content. In another configuration, a mathematical model of the books and their characters are developed and merged. Common aspects of the mathematical model then may be related to the user profile while aspects of the books that are not common to both books may be excluded from the analysis. 
       FIG. 9  illustrates a client server architecture that may be employed to provide literary recommendations to a user community. More precisely,  FIG. 9  is a block diagram of a communications system  900  configured enabling a client  910  to access a host  930  across a network  920  in order to receive services from a literary recommendation engine operated by a host. . Generally, the client  910  is configured to access content on the host  930 . 
     The client  910  may include one or more external interfaces from which the portable media device receives content. Typically, the external interface is used to receive electronic content and also software (e.g., firmware) that controls the operation of the portable media device. Examples of the external interface may include, but are not limited to, Universal Serial Bus (USB) and/or FireWire connections, wireless LAN interfaces (e.g., 802.11 (a), (b), (g), or (n)), Personal Area Network connections (e.g., infrared or Bluetooth TM), Wide Area Network connections, wireless phone connections, and/or proprietary interfaces. The external interface may be configured to exchange data with a client  910 , host  930 , and/or other portable media devices (not shown). 
     The client  910  typically includes a computing device enabling a user to exchange information over a communications network. The client  910  may include one or more devices capable of accessing content residing on client  910  and/or host  930 . The client  910  may include a controller (not shown) that processes instructions received from or generated by a software application, a program, a piece of code, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, which independently or collectively direct operations of the client  910 . The instructions may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal that is capable of being delivered to the client  910  or that may reside with the controller at client  910 . Client  910  may include a general-purpose computer (e.g., a personal computer (PC)) capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner, a workstation, a notebook computer, a PDA (“Personal Digital Assistant”), a wireless phone, a component, other equipment, or some combination of these items that is capable of responding to and executing instructions. 
     In one implementation, the client  910  includes one or more information retrieval software applications (e.g., a browser, a mail application, an instant messaging client, an Internet service provider client, or an AOL TV or other integrated client) capable of receiving one or more data units. The information retrieval applications may run on a general-purpose operating system and a hardware platform that includes a general-purpose processor and specialized hardware for graphics, communications and/or other capabilities. In another implementation, client  910  may include a wireless telephone running a micro-browser application on a reduced operating system with general purpose and specialized hardware capable of operating in mobile environments. 
     The client  910  may include one or more media or e-book reading applications. For example, the client  910  may include a software application that enables the client  910  to receive and display an e-book presented in a specified book format. The media applications may include controls that enable a user to configure the user&#39;s media environment. For example, if the e-book application is accessing an online bookstore or recommendation engine (such as those shown in  FIGS. 1-8 ), the media application may include controls that enable the user to select and purchase electronic books, for example, through the use of a recommendation engine and/or a web browsing application. 
     The client  910  may include an inspection engine that regulates use of the different communications interfaces which may be available. For example, the client  910  may be configured to route all communications requests through the inspection engine. The inspection engine may reference a communications configuration and selectively enable access to a communications network based on the nature of the communications request and the communications configuration. The inspection engine and e-book application may be used in an “armored” or trusted mode so that a communications interface and the underlying content may not be accessed without authorization. 
     In one implementation, the different applications requiring use of a communications interface are required to register with the compliance engine. Registering with the compliance engine may permit a registered application to access valuable, copyrighted content. For example, a registered application may treat the compliance engine as an internal communications module used to exchange data. The inspection module then may selectively enable access to content based on rules in the communications and permissions configuration. 
     In another implementation, the compliance engine internally announces itself as the communications interface. Applications need not register with the compliance engine in order to communicate. However, the compliance engine may only establish access to and communications in support of those communications described and authorized in the compliance file. 
     The network  920  typically includes hardware and/or software capable of enabling direct or indirect communications between the client  910  and the host  930 . As such, the network  920  may include a direct link between the client  910  and the host  930 , or it may include one or more networks or subnetworks between them (not shown). Each network or subnetwork may include, for example, a wired or wireless data pathway capable of carrying and receiving data. Examples of the delivery network include the Internet, the World Wide Web, a WAN (“Wide Area Network”), a LAN (“Local Area Network”), analog or digital wired and wireless telephone networks, radio, television, cable, satellite, and/or any other delivery mechanism for carrying data. 
     The host  930  generally includes one or more devices configured to distribute digital content. For example, the host  930  may offer a literary recommendation engine that allows users to navigate literary libraries. Typically, a host  930  includes a collection or library of content for distribution. Alternatively, or in addition, the host  930  may enable access to other forms of rich media content (or convert a media source such as a video or audio feed) into a feed of data units for transmission across the network  920 . The host  930  may include a general-purpose computer having a central processor unit (CPU), and memory/storage devices that store data and various programs such as an operating system and one or more application programs. Other examples of a host  930  includes a workstation, a server, a special purpose device or component, a broadcast system, other equipment, or some combination thereof capable of responding to and executing instructions in a defined manner. 
     The host  930  also may include an input/output (I/O) device (e.g., video and audio input and conversion capability), and peripheral equipment such as a communications card or device (e.g., a modem or a network adapter) for exchanging data with the network  920 . 
     The host  930  is generally capable of executing instructions under the command of a controller. The host  930  may be used to provide content to the client  910 . The controller may be implemented by a software application loaded on the host  930  for commanding and directing communications exchanged with the client  910 . Other examples of the controller include a program, a piece of code, an instruction, a device, a computer, a computer system, or a combination thereof, for independently or collectively instructing the client  910  or the host  930  to interact and operate as described. The host  930  may be embodied permanently or temporarily in any type of machine, component, physical or virtual equipment, storage medium, or propagated signal capable of providing instructions to the client  910  or the host  930 . 
     The host  930  may be configured to store content for the client  910 . In one implementation, the host  930  represents a central repository that stores a user&#39;s content. The host  930  then may be configured to enable user access to the user&#39;s library regardless of whether the user is using or is in proximity to a user&#39;s client. In another implementation, the host  930  represents a robust content store. The host  930  may be configured to provide Internet radio streams, enable a user to purchase a content selection, and enable access to promotional content. 
       FIG. 10  is a flow chart of a process by which a database of literary content is developed. Generally the operations shown in  FIG. 10  may be performed using the user interfaces and systems described previously. 
     Initially, a first description of a first literary object is received from a first data source ( 1010 ) and a second description of a second literary object is received from a second data source ( 1020 ). The first description of the literary object a mathematical or analytic label attached to a record in a database that facilitates processing and analytics in a manner that determines a mathematical or analytical relationship between an entry (object) in a database and other objects appearing in the database. Identifying similar aspects and/or the extent of a relationship between two objects may be masked where the underlying values reflect an analytical report or parsing of the underlying content. For example, two novels by a first author may have dramatically different relationship as early works focus on a pace of action and later works focus more on character development with less action. The descriptions may include a label for a pace of activity or a mathematical value representing the pace of activity. Thus, an operator looking at two different works by the same author or two different works in the same genre may not appreciate the similarities and differences between those works. While directly-read lead labels also may be employed to identify relationships, descriptions need not be limited to directly-read information. 
     The first description of the first literary object is related to the second description of the second literary object ( 1030 ). For example, a server may determine the relationship between an early work by John Grisham and more recent work. 
     Based on relating the first description of the first literary object to the second description of the second literary object, a degree of correlation is determined ( 1040 ). A threshold used to determine whether two objects are related is accessed ( 1050 ). The threshold with the degree of correlation is compared ( 1060 ). Based on comparing the degree of correlation with the threshold, it is determined whether the first literary object and the second literary object are related ( 1070 ). The degree of correlation can be stored in a database for subsequent manipulation and access so that related content can readily be identified. The first literary object and the second literary object may be consolidated into a merged record that includes a first aspect of the first literary object and a second aspect of the second literary object. For example, a list of novels with a first pace of activity and a list of novels with a second tone may be joined to create a record that identifies content with a first pace of activity and a second tone. If a user later looks for content responsive to their profile, records of this sort may be used to readily identify content. 
       FIG. 11  illustrates a method of recommending a literary object to a user. Initially, a first literary object in a database of literary objects is identified ( 1110 ). A first literary object includes a record with descriptors that may be used to mathematically identify relationships (or the relative strength of relationships) between content. A first model for the first literary object is developed ( 1120 ). The first model may include a record in a database that describes the mathematical relationship between one or more selections of content. A first stream of content with a sequence of records that includes a first record is accessed ( 1130 ). relationship between the first record and the first literary object is identified ( 1140 ).

     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 
     The invention is the method of combining distinctly separate processes to square white paper napkins, that once performed, result in full color 3D paper napkin objects bearing the same name that the napkin is folded into, which creates a new article of manufacture in the paper napkin or serviette industry, for use in the fields of arts and education, along with catering &amp; restaurants, seasonal parties, theme parties, birthday parties, origami folding challenges, and overall general daily paper napkin use. 
     BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION 
     The first distinct process in turning a white paper napkin into the full color 3D image bearing the same name that the napkin is folded into is the creation of a specifically arranged named color print design pattern, artistic rendering, or computer or photographic image, to match the named fold, and applying that color pattern onto square paper napkins. The secondary process is then applying the named pattern fold to like named pattern to create the full color 3D object. These patterns may appear to be an abstract image when not folded, yet will prove to be the specific design or configured pattern needed to create this new original article of manufacturing once the process of folding is applied. The design patterns are specific to each entity&#39;s fold name, and may not be interchanged.

     There are many toys related to basketball and to basketball games which may be used by both adults and children. These toys, which include miniaturized basketball-type apparatuses that fit on waste paper baskets, hook over the upper edge of a door, or mount to a generally vertical surface, are typically found in a residence or work place. These basketball toys are smaller than regulation basketball apparatuses and consequently utilize a smaller ball. Numerous other innovations for basketball toys have been provided in the art that are adequate for various purposes. 
     While these items fulfill their respective, particular objective and requirements, the aforementioned basketball toys have obvious constraints and suffer from common disadvantages making them undesirable for use in certain settings. For example, these basketball toys require attachment to other structures (e.g., a door, a wall, or a wastepaper basket) and require some assembly prior to use. Thus, they cannot be played at any place or location—such as the back seat of an automobile, on an airplane, or at a public park. Because of their size and bulkiness, these toys also do not make useful novelty games and devices as stocking stuffers, as give-away items at a sporting event or in connection with sales of a particular product or product promotions in general. Furthermore, many of these items are not amusing or otherwise appealing to the user. 
     What is needed is a hand-held product for playing a basketball game that is very inexpensive to manufacture, easily portable, practical as a novelty item, and appealing to users.
