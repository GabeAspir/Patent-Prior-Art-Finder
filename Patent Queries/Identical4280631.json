{"publication_number":"US-4280631-A","abstract_en":"The invention relates to an improvement in a child resistant liquid seal closure and container combination. The container neck has one or more locking projections which engage one or more locking lugs on the interior surface of the closure to prevent rotational removal of the closure from the container. To remove the closure, the cap skirt must be squeezed and distorted to disengage the lugs radially outwardly from the locking projections on the container neck. A snap cap liner is retained within the closure, adjacent the inside surface of the top panel. As the closure is rotated onto the container, this liner snaps into place onto the top of the container neck, and forms a primary liquid seal. Although the final orientation of the outer closure and bottle is effected by the relative position of the locking lugs and projecting cam, this orientation does not affect the primary seal formed by the internal snap cap liner.","Citations":"US-3788510-A,US-3941268-A,US-3955696-A"}
